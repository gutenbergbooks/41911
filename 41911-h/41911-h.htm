<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The experience of the Australian Army Medical
Service, since the outbreak of war, is probably
unique in history. The hospitals sent out by the
Australian Government were suddenly transferred
from a position of anticipated idleness to a scene
of intense activity, were expanded in capacity to
an unprecedented extent, and probably saved the
position of the entire medical service in Egypt.</p>

<p>The disasters following the landing at Gallipoli
are now well known, and the following pages will
show how well the A.A.M.C. responded to the call
then made upon it.</p>

<p>When the facts are fully known, its achievements
will be regarded as amongst the most effective and
successful on the part of the Commonwealth forces.</p>

<p>In the following pages we have set out the problems
which faced the A.A.M.C. in Egypt, regarding both
Red Cross and hospital management, the necessities
which forced one 520-bed hospital to expand to a
capacity of approximately 10,500 beds, and the
manner in which the work was done.</p>

<p>The experience gained during this critical period
enables us to indicate a policy the adoption of which
will enable similar undertakings in future to be
developed with less difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span></p>

<p>We desire to acknowledge gratefully the permission
to publish documents granted by General
Sir William Birdwood and Dr. Ruffer of Alexandria,
and also much valuable help given by Mr.
Howard D'Egville.</p>

<p>The beautiful photographs which are reproduced
were mostly taken by Private Frank Tate, to whom
our best thanks are due.</p>

<p>In any reference to the work of the Australian
Army Medical Corps in Egypt it must never be
forgotten that the expansion of No. 1 Australian
General Hospital was effected under the personal
direction of the officer commanding, Lieut.-Colonel
Ramsay Smith, who was responsible for a development
probably unequalled in the history of medicine.</p>

<p>The story told is the outcome of our personal
experience and consequently relates largely to No. 1
Australian General Hospital, with which we were
both connected.</p>

<p class="center"><big><b>CHAPTER I</b></big></p>


<p>Prior to the outbreak of war in August 1914, the
Australian Army Medical Corps consisted of one
whole-time medical officer, the Director-General of
Medical Services, Surgeon-General Williams, C.B.,
a part-time principal medical officer in each of the six
States (New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland,
South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania),
and a number of regimental officers. With the
exception of the Director-General, all the medical
officers were engaged in civil practice, which absorbed
the greater portion of their energy.</p>

<p>The system of compulsory military training which
came into operation in 1911 was creating a new
medical service, by the appointment of Area Medical
Officers, whose functions were to render the necessary
medical services in given areas, apart from camp
work. These also were mostly men in civil practice,
to whom the military service was a supplementary
means of livelihood.</p>

<p>Camps were formed at periodical intervals for the
training of the troops, the duration of the camps
rarely exceeding a week. At these camps a certain
number of regimental medical officers were in attendance,
and were exercised in ambulance and field-dressing
work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>In common with the members of other portions
of the British Empire, few medical practitioners in
Australia had regarded the prospect of war seriously,
and in consequence the most active and influential
members of the profession, with some notable
exceptions, held aloof from army medical service.</p>

<p>In 1907, however, owing to the representations of
Surgeon-General Williams, and to the obvious risk
with which the Empire was threatened, senior
members of the profession volunteered and joined
the Army Medical Reserve, so that they would be
available for service in time of war. The surgeons
and physicians to the principal hospitals received
the rank of Major in the reserve, and the assistant surgeons
and assistant physicians the rank of Captain.
Some attempt was made to give these officers instruction
by the P.M.O's, but the response was not
enthusiastic, and little came of it.</p>

<p>At the same time there were a number of medical
officers in the Australian Army Medical Corps who
possessed valuable experience of war, notably the
Director-General, whose capacity for organisation
evidenced in South Africa and elsewhere made for
him a lasting reputation. The Principal Medical
Officer for Victoria, Colonel Charles Ryan, had
served with distinction in the war with Serbia in
1876, and in the war between Russia and Turkey
in 1877. A fair number of the regimental officers
had seen service in South Africa. The bulk of the
medical practitioners concerned, however, had not
only no knowledge of military duty, but certainly
no conception whatever of military organisation and
discipline; and what was still more serious, no real
and adequate realisation of the extraordinary part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
that can be played in war by an efficient medical
service by prophylaxis.</p>

<p>Such, then, was the position when war was declared.</p>

<p>The response from the people throughout Australia
was, as Australians expected, practically
unanimous. They determined to throw in their lot
with Great Britain and do everything that was
possible to aid. This determination found immediate
expression in the decision of the Government
of Mr. Joseph Cook, endorsed later by the
Government of Mr. Fisher, to raise and equip a
division of 18,000 men and send it to the front as
fast as possible. The system of compulsory military
service entails no obligation on the trainee to leave
Australia, and in any event, the system having been
introduced so late as 1911, the trainees were not
available. The expedition consequently became a
volunteer expedition from the outset. Volunteers
were rapidly forthcoming, camps were established in
the various States and training was actively begun.</p>

<p>Of the difficulty and delays consequent on the
raising of such a force&mdash;of men mostly civilians,
of all classes of society, without clothing, or with
insufficient clothing and equipment of all kinds&mdash;little
need be said. The difficulties were slowly
overcome, and the force gradually became somewhat
efficient. As both officers and men were learning
their business together, the difficulties may well be
imagined. In fairness, however, it should be said
that from the physical and from the mental point of
view the material was probably the finest that could
be obtained.</p>

<p>We are, however, only concerned here with the
medical aspect of the movement. The medical establishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
was modelled on that of Great Britain,
and consisted of regimental medical officers and
of three field ambulances. The Director-General
accompanied the expedition as Director of Medical
Services, and Colonel Chas. Ryan, the Principal
Medical Officer of the State of Victoria, accompanied
the expedition as A.D.M.S. on the staff of General
Bridges, the Commander of the Division. Colonel
Fetherston took General Williams's place as Acting
Director-General of Medical Services, and Colonel
Cuscaden the place of Colonel Ryan as Principal
Medical Officer of the State of Victoria.</p>

<p>The expedition left in October, a considerable
delay having taken place owing to the necessity
of finding suitable convoy, a number of German
cruisers being still afloat and active. It reached
Egypt without serious mishap in December, and at
once encamped near the Pyramids at Mena.</p>

<p>There were some difficulties in transit. There was
a most extensive outbreak of ptomaine poisoning
on one ship, and measles, bronchitis, and pneumonia
were much in evidence. The mortality was, however,
small. The division on arrival settled down
to hard training.</p>

<p>At once difficulties caused by the absence of Lines
of Communication Medical Units became obvious.
The amount of sickness surprised those who had
not profited by previous experience. To meet
the difficulty Mena House Hotel was improvised
as a hospital and staffed by regimental and field
ambulance officers.</p>

<p>At this stage, however, we can leave the division
and return to the further development of medical
necessities in Australia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Steps were at once taken in Australia to raise a
second division, and subsequently a third and other
divisions in the same manner as the preceding.
As time passed on, the unsuitability of some of the
camps and the lack of medical military knowledge
told their tale, and a number of serious outbreaks of
disease took place. It is impossible to give accurate
statistical evidence, but the Australian public seems
to have been shocked that young, healthy, and well-fed
men should <i>in camp life</i> have been so seriously
damaged and destroyed. The causes as usual were
measles, bronchitis, pneumonia, tonsillitis, and later
on a serious outbreak of infective cerebro-spinal
meningitis which was stamped out with difficulty
and took toll (<i>inter alia</i>) in the shape of the lives of
three medical men. The sanitation of the Broadmeadows
Camp near Melbourne was not such as to
provoke respect or admiration. The camp was
ultimately regarded as unsuitable, and moved to
Seymour, pending the necessary improvements.</p>

<p>It is instructive to note in passing that the Australian
public received a shock when they were first
informed of the amount of disease among the troops
in Egypt. Yet it was apparently nothing like so
great as that which existed in Australia, where
the usual death-rate is so low. And yet, had
the Service really profited by the lessons of the
Russo-Japanese war, much of the trouble might
have been avoided. The truth of course is that
camp life, except under rigorous discipline as regards
hygiene, and the loyal observance of that
discipline by each soldier, is much more dangerous
than the great majority of people seem to imagine.
The benefit of the open-air life and of exercise is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
counteracted by the chances of infection due to
crowding, defective tent ventilation, the absence of
the toothbrush, and other causes.</p>

<p>In September, however, the Imperial Government
notified the Australian Government that Lines of
Communication Medical Units were required, and
for the first time the majority of members of the
Australian Army Medical Corps became aware of the
nature of Lines of Communication Medical Units.
The Government decided to equip and staff a
Casualty Clearing Station, then called the Clearing
Hospital, two Stationary Hospitals (200 beds each),
and two Base Hospitals (each 520 beds). They
were organised on the R.A.M.C. pattern, and the
total staff required was approximately eighty medical
officers. Even at this juncture the matter was
not taken very seriously, and there was some doubt
as to the nature of the response. The Director of
Medical Services was anxious that the base hospitals
should be commanded and staffed by men of weight
and experience, and accordingly a number of the
senior medical consultants in the Australian cities
decided to volunteer. The example was infectious
and there were over-applications for the positions.</p>

<p>The First Casualty Clearing Station was to a great
extent raised and equipped in Tasmania. The
First Stationary Hospital was raised and equipped
in South Australia, the Second Stationary Hospital
in Western Australia, and the Second General
Hospital in New South Wales. An exception to
this sound territorial arrangement was, however,
made in the case of the First Australian General
Hospital&mdash;an exception which proved unfortunate.
The commanding officer, a senior lieutenant-colonel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
was resident in South Australia. The hospital
itself was recruited from Queensland, but as the
Queensland medical profession was hardly strong
enough to supply the whole of the medical personnel,
most of the consultants, including all the
lieutenant-colonels, were recruited in Victoria. Now
Brisbane, the capital of Queensland, is some 1,200
miles by rail from Melbourne, and Melbourne about
400 miles by rail from Adelaide, the capital of
South Australia. The result of these arrangements
was that the captains and some of the majors were
recruited in Queensland, together with the bulk of
the rank and file and many of the nurses; whilst
most of the senior medical officers, the matron,
and a number of nurses were recruited in
Melbourne, and the commanding officer (Lt.-Colonel
Ramsay Smith) from South Australia. He brought
with him some seven or eight clerks and orderlies.
Furthermore a number of medical students and
educated men joined in Melbourne. The bulk of
the staff was, however, based in Queensland. This
arrangement led to untold difficulties in the way
of recruiting, and it is remarkable that the result
should have been as satisfactory as it was. The
equipment was provided partly from Melbourne,
partly from Brisbane, and partly from South Australia.
As the commanding officer was in South
Australia, as the registrar and secretary was in Melbourne,
and as the orderly officer was in Brisbane,
some idea of the difficulties can well be imagined&mdash;particularly
when it is remembered that with the
exception of the commanding officer and a few
officers, the members of the staff had no experience
whatsoever of military matters. Nevertheless an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
earnest effort was made to secure the necessary
equipment and personnel. In Melbourne great
trouble was taken to secure as many medical
students and educated men as could possibly be
obtained.</p>

<p>On the whole the response to the call was more
than satisfactory, and Australian people were of
the opinion that a stronger staff could not have
been secured.</p>

<p>It was at first intimated that specialists were
not required, but ultimately after discussion the
Government agreed to find the salary of one
specialist. Consequently a radiographer was appointed
with the rank of Major, and another officer
was appointed oculist to the hospital with the rank
of honorary Major. Subsequently he was appointed
as secretary and registrar in addition, but without
salary or allowances.</p>

<p>The equipment of the hospital was on the R.A.M.C.
pattern, and was supposed to be complete. Furthermore,
the Australian branch of the British Red Cross
Society set aside for the use of the hospital one
hundred cubic tons of Red Cross goods which were
specially prepared and labelled at Government
House, Melbourne.</p>

<p>THE VOYAGE OF THE "KYARRA"&mdash;LACK OF ADEQUATE

POISONING.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><big><b>CHAPTER II</b></big></p>

<p>The mode of conveyance of the hospitals to the
front next engaged the attention of the authorities,
and negotiations were entered into with various
steamship companies. It was desirable that the
hospitals should be conveyed under the protection
of the regulations of the Geneva Convention.</p>

<p>After some negotiation and the rejection of larger
and more suitable steamers, a coastal steamer, the
<i>Kyarra</i>, was selected and was fitted to carry the
hospital staff and equipment. The steamer is of
about 7,000 tons burden. There were on board
approximately 83 medical officers, 180 nurses, and
about 500 rank and file, or a total of nearly 800
souls. The cargo space was supposed to be ample,
and 100 tons of space were promised for the Red
Cross stores.</p>

<p>When ready, the <i>Kyarra</i> proceeded to Brisbane
and embarked a portion of the First Australian
General Hospital. She then proceeded to Sydney,
embarked the Second Australian General Hospital
with its stores, equipment, and Red Cross goods,
and then left for Melbourne, where she was to
embark the remainder of the First Australian
General Hospital, the First Stationary Hospital,
and the Casualty Clearing Station.</p>

<p>On arrival at Melbourne, however, it was found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
that she was carrying ordinary cargo, that she
was not lighted as required by the rules of the
Convention, and that she was already fully loaded.
Consequently the whole of the cargo was taken out
of her, the ordinary cargo was removed, and she was
reloaded. It was found, however, that there was
no room for the Red Cross goods belonging to the
First Australian General Hospital. Furthermore, a
portion of the equipment which subsequently turned
out to be invaluable, namely 130 extra beds donated
to the hospital by a firm in Adelaide, was nearly
left behind. It was only by the exercise of personal
pressure that space was found for this valuable
addition at the last minute. The importance of
this donation will be mentioned later in the story.</p>

<p>Finally, after many delays, the <i>Kyarra</i> left
Melbourne on December 5 amidst the goodwill and
the blessings of the people, and made her way to
Fremantle, there to embark the Second Australian
Stationary Hospital and its equipment. She finally
left Fremantle with this additional hospital, and
made her way across the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Col. Martin, Commanding Officer of the
No. 2 Australian General Hospital, was promoted to
the rank of Colonel for the voyage only. He was
promoted for the purpose of placing him in command
of the troopship.</p>

<p>The voyage of the <i>Kyarra</i> involved calls at
Colombo, Aden, Suez, Port Said, and Alexandria.
Those on board believed in the first instance
they were proceeding to France, and when they
arrived at Alexandria, and found they were all destined
for Egypt, many expressed feelings of keen
disappointment on the ground that they would
have no work to do. They were soon, however, to
be undeceived.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a href="images/i032.jpg"><img src="images/i032-t.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="" /></a><br />

<i>To face page 14</i></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>The voyage itself does not call for lengthy comment.
The ship was unsuitable for the purpose
for which she had been chartered. She was
small, overcrowded, and not as clean or sanitary
as she might have been. Her speed seemed to
decrease, and was scarcely respectable at any time;
there were apparently breakdowns of the engines;
and the food supplied to the officers and nurses
was not infrequently inferior in quality and in preparation.
In consequence an outbreak of ptomaine
poisoning took place, and twenty-two officers and
others were infected, two of them seriously.</p>

<p>The arrangements at the men's canteen had not
been fully thought out, and in the Tropics it was
not possible to obtain fruit of any description.
Fresh or tinned fruits were not kept in stock. There
was some tinned meat and fish, but the men could
obtain nothing to drink except a mixture made
from Colombo limes and water.</p>

<p>There was a certain amount of illness apart from
ptomaine poisoning, and amongst the cases treated
were bronchitis, influenza, tonsillitis, and eye disease.
Five cases reacted severely to anti-typhoid inoculation,
and required rest in hospital.</p>

<p>On the whole, officers, nurses, and men took the
voyage seriously, and did their best to learn something
of their work. The officers were drilled, the
nurses gave lessons to the orderlies, and systematic
lectures were given by the officers. An electric
lantern had been provided by the O.C., and lantern
lectures were given regularly during the voyage.</p>

<p>The quarters provided in the fore part of the ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
for the men were certainly insanitary, and to an
extent dangerous. Towards the end of the voyage
many cases of rotten potatoes were thrown overboard,
having been removed from beneath the
quarters occupied by the men. With Red Cross aid,
however, provided by the Queensland branch, fans
had been installed, and an attempt made to render
these quarters more sanitary and habitable. A
portion of the deck could not be used because
of leaky engines, and neither request nor remonstrance
enabled those concerned to get these leaks
stopped.</p>

<p>The following measurements show what trouble
so simple a fault can cause. In the tropics the wet
portion of the deck could not of course be used for
sleeping purposes.</p>

</table></div>

<p>As the number of men occupying these quarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
(including sergeants and warrant officers) was about
300, the space available approximated 5 sq. ft.
per man.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these conditions, the usual
peculiarity of Anglo-Saxon human nature showed
itself when at the end of the voyage the officers were
required to sign the necessary certificates stating
that the catering had been satisfactory. Only three
refused to sign; the remainder signed, mostly with
qualifications.</p>

<p>The manner in which the average Australian
makes light of his misfortunes was strikingly illustrated
on one occasion. A long, mournful procession
of privates slowly walked around the deck. In
front, with bowed head, was a soldier in clerical garb,
an open book in his hand. Immediately behind him
were four solemn pall-bearers, carrying the day's meat
ration, which is stated to have been "very dead."
Apparently the entire ship's company acted as
mourners. The procession wended its way to the
stern, where an appropriate burial service was read;
the ship's bugler sounded the "last post," and the
remains were committed to the deep. Needless to
say the usual formality of stopping the ship during
the burial service was not observed on this occasion.
An attempt to repeat the performance was fortunately
stopped by those in authority, and all subsequent
"burials" were strictly unceremonious.</p>

<p>Those who go to war must expect to rough it, but
on a peaceful ocean, secure from the enemy, and in
a modern passenger ship, it should be possible to
provide food which does not imperil those who
consume it, and also to ensure reasonable comfort.</p>

<p>With reference to the defects of the ship it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
should be said that when the <i>Kyarra</i> was chartered
Australians had not realised the colossal nature
of the war, and had not begun to think on a
large scale, and those responsible had neither
tradition nor experience to guide them. Furthermore
the commander and officers of the <i>Kyarra</i>
courteously did their best, but it was evident they
understood the difficulty of transforming a coastal
steamer into a Hospital Transport.</p>

<p>The Geneva Convention does not seem to be fully
understood, and experience shows what complicated
conditions arise, and how easy it is to commit an
unintentional breach of the Regulations. But in
war there can be no excuses.</p>

<p class="center"><big><b>CHAPTER III</b></big></p>


<p>On arrival at Alexandria, there seemed to be no great
hurry in disembarking, and many of the older medical
officers were fully persuaded that the units were
not wanted in France; that there was very little to do
in Egypt; and that if their services were not required
it would be fairer to inform them of the fact, and let
them go home again. They were soon to be undeceived.
A message was received asking the O.C.s
of the various units to visit Cairo, where they waited
on Surgeon-General Ford, Director of Medical
Services to the Force in Egypt. They were informed
that there was more than enough work for all these
Lines of Communication Medical Units in Egypt.</p>

<p>The First Australian General Hospital was to be
placed in the Heliopolis Palace Hotel at Heliopolis.
The Second Australian General Hospital was to take
over Mena House and release the regimental medical
officers and officers of the Field Ambulances from
the hospital work they were doing. The First
Stationary Hospital was to be placed with the military
camp at Maadi, and the Second Australian
Stationary Hospital was to go into camp at Mena
and undertake the treatment of cases of venereal
diseases. The First Casualty Station was temporarily
lodged in Heliopolis, and then sent to Port Said to
form a small hospital there in view of the imminent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
fighting on the Canal. These dispositions were
made as soon as possible.</p>

<p>It should be noted at this juncture that the bulk
of the Australian Forces, namely the First Division,
was camped at Mena. A certain quantity of Light
Horse was encamped at Maadi, whilst the Second
Division, composed chiefly of New Zealanders, was
encamped near Heliopolis. New Zealand had not
provided any Lines of Communication Units, but her
sick had been accommodated at the British Military
Hospital, Citadel, Cairo, and also at the Egyptian
Army Hospital, Abbassia.</p>

<p>The First and Second Stationary Hospitals used
their tents for the respective purposes. The Casualty
Clearing Station utilised a building assigned to it
in Port Said.</p>

<p>Some description is required, however, of the
Heliopolis Palace Hotel. This, as the photograph
shows, is a huge hotel de luxe, consisting of a basement
and four stories.</p>

<p>It was arranged that the kitchens, stores, and
accommodation for rank and file should be placed
in the basement. The first floor was allotted to
offices and officers' quarters; a wing of the third floor
provided accommodation for nurses, and the only
portions of the building used at first for patients
were the large restaurant and dining-room, and
the billiard recesses, <i>i.e.</i> the Rotundas and Great
Hall.</p>

<p>The hospital when fully developed required a
large staff. The two large wards in the Rotundas
and Central Hall could be administered easily
enough, but the rest of the hotel consisted of rooms
holding from three to six beds. The doors were
removed. There were fortunately many bathrooms
and lavatories. The rooms are very lofty, and
provided with very large windows, but there are no
fanlights over the doors, so that if doors were left
in place ventilation was inadequate. A good deal
of difficulty was experienced in providing suitable
slop hoppers and sinks, places for cleaning bed-pans
and the like, but little by little suitable arrangements
were made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The Arab servants, employed to ease the pressure
on the staff, were housed in tents in one part of the
grounds, and some of the rank and file in tents
in another part. Others, for a short period, slept
on the roof. The accommodation in general of the
rank and file was excellent. The kitchens were a
source of difficulty as the ranges were so elaborate;
the hot-water service was unsatisfactory because of
failure of fuel due to war conditions. Still, by one
device and another, smooth running was ultimately
secured.</p>

<p>When full value is given to all adverse criticism,
it must be admitted that few better surgical hospitals
could have been obtained.</p>

<p>The Officer Commanding the hospital (Lt.-Colonel
Ramsay Smith) visited it with the Registrar, and made
the preliminary arrangements. He then returned to
Alexandria to supervise the disembarkation. Meanwhile
the Registrar spent his time interviewing
the proprietors, the D.M.S., and others concerned.</p>

<p>Only those who, knowing nothing of military
organisation, tackle a job of the kind can fully
appreciate the bewilderment caused by the mystic
letters A.D. of S. and T., D.A.A. and Q.M.G., and the
like, with all they connote. The Imperial officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
saw the difficulties and were kindly and helpful to a
remarkable degree.</p>

<p>The hospital was opened on January 25, with
provision for 200 patients. The first patient to be
admitted was suffering from eye disease. An ophthalmic
department was opened on the first floor,
providing accommodation for out-patients as well as
in-patients. As there were few oculists and aurists
in Egypt at this juncture other than those at this
hospital, the department rapidly assumed formidable
proportions. The solid floors, lofty rooms,
shuttered windows, and provision of electric light
lent themselves to the creation of an excellent
ophthalmic department.</p>

<p>The number of soldiers within easy distance of
Heliopolis was not very great. Nevertheless patients,
mostly medical cases, made their appearance in
steadily increasing numbers, especially as Mena
House was soon filled, and was limited in its
accommodation.</p>

<p>With the arrival of the Second Australian Division
in Egypt, and of subsequent reinforcements, the
pressure on the First Australian General Hospital
intensified, since these new arrivals went into
camp at or near Heliopolis. The hotel rooms
were filled with valuable furniture, including large
carpets. From the outset it was arranged that
neither carpets nor curtains were to be retained,
and that the only hotel furniture which was to be
used was beds and bedding for the officers and
nurses. Everything else was stored away in various
rooms. Up to this period the belief in official circles
was that the First Australian General Hospital would
soon be moved to France, and that it was consequently
unwise to expand further, or to spend any
considerable sum of money. The pressure, however,
steadily continued, and when the Dardanelles
campaign commenced, orders were given for the
immediate expansion of the hospital to meet the
ever-growing requirements of the troops. In order
to effect this development the whole of the hotel
furniture was moved into corridors of the building.
Subsequently it was taken from the building and
stored elsewhere, a difficult proceeding involving a
great deal of labour.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Venereal and Infectious Diseases Camp</span></h3>

<p>On February 7 a New Zealand Field Ambulance
which had taken charge of the venereal cases
in camp, nearly 250 in number, was summarily
ordered to the Suez Canal. Orders were given on
that evening at 9 p.m. that the tent equipment of
the First Australian General Hospital was to be
erected at the Aerodrome Camp (about three-quarters
of a mile distant), and that the hospital was to
staff and equip a Venereal Diseases Camp by 2 p.m.
the following day. By this time, too, large numbers
of cases of measles had made their appearance,
and it was quite clear that some provision must
be made for these and other infectious cases.
Accordingly another camp was pitched alongside
the Venereal Camp for the accommodation of those
suffering from infectious diseases. By direction of
the D.M.S. Egypt, a senior surgeon was appointed
to command the camp, and was given the services
of two medical officers, one in connection with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the venereal cases, and one in connection with the
infectious cases. Definite orders were given that
such cases were not to be admitted into the
General Hospital.</p>

<p>The camp was no sooner pitched than it was
filled, and the demand on the accommodation for
venereal and other cases rose until upwards of 400
venereal cases, and 100 infectious cases&mdash;chiefly
measles&mdash;were provided for. A good deal of difficulty
was experienced in suitably providing for the
serious measles cases in camp, and accordingly a
limited number of tents were erected in the hospital
grounds, and a small camp was formed in that position,
and placed under the charge of a nursing sister.
To this camp all serious cases of infectious disease,
and all cases with complications, were immediately
transferred. It may be said in passing that the
cases treated in this way did exceedingly well.</p>

<p>The number of venereal cases would have wholly
out-stepped the accommodation had it not been
for the policy adopted by the D.M.S. Egypt.
All venereal cases not likely to recover rapidly
were sent back to Australia, or (on one occasion) to
Malta.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Acquisition of Many Buildings</span></h3>

<p>The hospital, then, at this juncture consisted of
the main building, in which the accommodation was
being steadily extended by the utilisation of all
the rooms, and of the venereal and infectious diseases
camp.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The first khamsin, however, which blew warned
every one concerned that patients could not be
treated satisfactorily in tents in midsummer. At the
request of the medical officer in charge, two rooms
in one wing of the main building were given
over to bad infectious cases, and the camp in
the grounds was abolished. The arrangement was
unsatisfactory. The cases did not do as well as
might have been desired, though this was attributed
to an alteration in their type; and renewed efforts
were made to devise a better arrangement. Finally
a portion of the Abbassia barracks was obtained,
and converted into an excellent venereal diseases
hospital to which the venereal cases were transferred.</p>

<p>The Mena camp had been struck, and the troops
sent to the Dardanelles; the First and Second
Stationary hospitals had moved to Mudros; and the
First Casualty Clearing Station had been transferred
to the Dardanelles. Consequently the pressure fell
almost entirely on the First General Hospital, and
the Venereal Diseases Hospital thus became the only
Venereal Diseases Hospital in Egypt.</p>

<p>Close to the Palace Hotel there was a large pleasure
resort, known as the Luna Park, at one end of which
was a large wooden skating-rink, enclosed by a balcony
on four sides. This building was obtained, and was
railed off from the rest of Luna Park by a fence
13 feet high. The infectious cases from the camp
were then transferred to it. A camp kitchen was
built, and an admirable open-air infectious diseases
hospital was obtained. It became obvious, however,
that the skating-rink, which with the balcony could
accommodate, if necessary, 750 patients, might
better serve as an overflow hospital in case of
emergency, and accordingly efforts were made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
obtain another infectious diseases hospital in the
vicinity.</p>

<p>Eventually a fine building known as the Race
Course Casino, a few hundred yards from the Heliopolis
Palace, was obtained and converted into an
infectious diseases hospital providing for the accommodation
of about 200 patients. With its ample
piazzas and excellent ventilation it formed an ideal
hospital, and was reluctantly abandoned at a later
date owing to the development of structural defects
which threatened its stability.</p>

<p>The position, then, at this stage was that the First
Australian General Hospital consisted of (1) the
Palace Hotel, ever increasing in its accommodation
as the furniture was steadily removed and space
economised, its magnificent piazzas utilised, and
tents erected in the grounds for the accommodation
of the staff; of (2) the rink at Luna Park,
which was now empty and ready for the reception
of light cases overflowing from the Palace; of
(3) the Casino next door to Luna Park, which had
now become an infectious diseases hospital; and
of (4) the Venereal Diseases Hospital at Abbassia,
which soon became an independent command
though still staffed from No. 1 General Hospital.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Preparation in Anticipation</span></h3>

<p>At or shortly before this period, however, the
authorities had become aware that wounded might
be received from the Dardanelles at some future date
in considerable numbers, which could not, however,
be accurately estimated. Accordingly a consultation
was held between Surgeon-General Ford and Surgeon-General
Williams (who arrived in Egypt in February),
Colonel Sellheim, who was the officer commanding
the newly formed Australian Intermediate Base,
the O.C. of the First Australian General Hospital,
Lieut.-Col. Ramsay Smith, and Lieut.-Col. Barrett.
It was decided to authorise the expenditure of a
considerable sum of money in making the necessary
preparation, on the ground that if the wounded did
not arrive the Australian Government would justify
this action, and that if the wounded did arrive
a reasonable attempt would have been made to
meet the difficulty. Instructions were accordingly
given to buy up beds, bedding, and equipment,
which would <i>inter alia</i> provide at least another
150 beds in the Infectious Diseases Hospital and
750 in the rink. At first iron beds were purchased,
but it was impossible to obtain deliveries
of iron beds at a rate exceeding 120 a week,
and there were (practically) none ready made in
Egypt. It was during this period of expansion
that the donation of 130 beds made to Lieut.-Col.
Ramsay Smith in Adelaide proved to be so
useful.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, quite certain that full provision
could not be made in time if iron beds were to be
used, and accordingly large purchases of palm beds
were made. These are very strong, stoutly constructed
beds, made of palm wood. They are quite
comfortable and last for several months. The drawback
is that they are liable ultimately to become
vermin-infected and that their sharp projecting
struts are very apt to catch the dresses of those who
pass by. We were able, however, to obtain them
with mattresses at a rate exceeding 100 a day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
They were ordered in practically unlimited numbers,
so that shortly there was accommodation for the
900 patients referred to. In addition a large
reserve of beds and mattresses had been created
so that they could be placed in the corridors if
it became necessary.</p>

<p>At an earlier date the project of taking the whole
of Luna Park and using the upper portion of it, the
Pavilion, as well as the lower portion, the Rink, had
been under contemplation, but had been rejected
on the ground of expense. The rental demanded
was high, owing to the fact that the park must
perforce be closed as a pleasure resort if used as a
hospital.</p>

<p>The conveyance of sick and wounded from
Cairo to Heliopolis next engaged attention, and
on April 26 it was found possible to run trains
from Cairo on the tram-lines to Heliopolis Palace
Hotel. A trial run was made about midnight on
the 27th. The first train containing sick from
Mudros arrived on the evening of the 28th, and on
the 29th and 30th without warning the wounded
poured into Heliopolis.</p>

<p>As soon as the nature of the engagement at the
Dardanelles became known, the D.M.S. Egypt
ordered that the whole of Luna Park be taken over
and immediately equipped. The pavilion was made
ready for the reception of the wounded within a
very few hours, and in a few days Luna Park was so
equipped with baths, latrines, beds, bedding, etc.,
that it could accommodate 1,650 patients.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Never before in history were precautions better
justified. Had the expenditure not been incurred,
had the representative of the Australian Government
held up the execution of the policy of preparation
by waiting for instructions, a disaster
would have occurred, and many wounded would have
been treated in tents in the sand of the desert.
Yet so strangely constituted is a minor section of
humanity that instead of satisfaction being expressed
that the best possible had been done, some
criticism was levelled at the undertaking on the
ground that it was not at the outset technically
perfect, and that it showed the initial defects inseparable
from rapid improvisation. The Australian
people should be profoundly grateful to Surgeon-General
Williams and Colonel Sellheim, whose decisive
promptitude enabled the position to be saved.</p>

<p class="center"><big><b>CHAPTER IV</b></big></p>


<p>During the first ten days of the crisis approximately
16,000 wounded men entered Egypt, of whom the
greater number were sent to Cairo, and during those
ten days an acute competition ensued between the
supply of beds and the influx of patients. Fortunately
the supply kept ahead of the demand, the
pressure being eased by the immediate provision
at Al Hayat, Helouan, of a convalescent hospital
capable of accommodating 1,000 and in an emergency
even 1,500 patients.</p>

<p>At the end of the ten days referred to, the position
was as follows:</p>

<p>Heliopolis Palace Hotel had expanded to 1,000
beds, Luna Park accommodated 1,650 patients, the
Casino would accommodate 250, the Convalescent
Hospital, Al Hayat, Helouan, was accommodating
700, and if need be could accommodate 1,500
patients, and the Venereal Diseases Hospital could
receive 500 patients.</p>

<p>In the meantime No. 2 General Hospital had been
transferred to Ghezira Palace Hotel, which was
rapidly equipped, and at a later date became capable
of receiving as many as 900 patients. Mena House
remained an overflow hospital, bearing the same
relation to No. 2 General Hospital as the Auxiliary
Hospitals at Heliopolis bore to No. 1 General
Hospital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>It was quite evident, however, that the accommodation
was still insufficient, and a further search
was made for other buildings. At this juncture a
building opposite Luna Park known as the Atelier
was offered by a Belgian firm for the use of the sick
and wounded. It consisted of a very large brick
building, with a stone floor and a lofty roof, which
had been used as a joinery factory. At first the
idea was entertained of creating a purely medical
hospital, and of keeping the Heliopolis Palace for
heavy surgery, with the auxiliaries for lighter cases.
This policy was found to be impracticable, and
the Atelier was converted into a 400-bed auxiliary
hospital similar in character to Luna Park.</p>

<p>It was open for the reception of patients on
June 10, and on the 11th was practically full of
wounded.</p>

<p>As it was evident that the accommodation was
still insufficient, a further search was made, and
the Sporting Club pavilion, a building in the vicinity
of the Heliopolis Palace, was taken over, and
converted into a hospital of 250 beds. It was at
first intended to use it as an infectious diseases
hospital. As, however, it possessed great possibilities
of expansion if suitable hutting could be
erected, another infectious diseases hospital was
sought elsewhere, and wooden shelters were erected.
The accommodation of the Sporting Club was raised
by this means to 1,250 beds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a href="images/i063.jpg"><img src="images/i063-t.jpg" width="400" height="257" alt="" /></a><br />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Atelier, Heliopolis.</span><br />
<i>To face page 37</i></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>The heat of summer was coming on, and the
necessity for providing seaside accommodation for
the convalescents from Cairo became obvious.
Consequently the Ras el Tin school at Alexandria
was taken by No. 1 General Hospital, and turned
into an excellent convalescent hospital for 500
patients. It consisted of a very large courtyard,
surrounded by (mostly) one-story buildings, and was
about 400 yards from the sea. In the courtyard
a Recreation Tent, provided by the British Red
Cross Australian Branch, was erected by the
Y.M.C.A. The whole formed an admirable seaside
convalescent hospital.</p>

<p>But even now the accommodation was not sufficient,
and by direction the Grand Hotel, Helouan,
was acquired, and converted into an additional convalescent
hospital for 500 patients. This institution,
however, was shortly afterwards transferred to the
Imperial authorities and used for British troops.</p>

<p>The structural defects in the Casino or Infectious
Diseases Hospital, and the undesirability of using the
Sporting Club for this purpose, necessitated the
erection of an Infectious Diseases Hospital elsewhere.
A beautifully constructed private hospital,
the Austrian Hospital at Choubra, was commandeered
and staffed by the First Australian General
Hospital, and provided 250 beds. This hospital
also was, however, soon transferred to the Imperial
authorities, and administered as a British hospital.</p>

<p>As the demand for accommodation for infectious
cases increased, the artillery barracks at Abbassia
were taken over by the Australian authorities, and
converted into an Infectious Diseases Hospital which
ultimately accommodated 1,250 patients.</p>

<p>The needs continuing to press, the Montazah
Palace at Alexandria was offered by His Highness the
Sultan to Lady Graham as a convalescent hospital.
The offer was gratefully accepted by the combined
British and Australian Branches of the Red Cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Society. It is the only hospital in Egypt in the
administration of which the Australian Red Cross
takes part.</p>

<p>In addition to these major activities, there were
many other minor changes. The introduction of
cholera from Gallipoli was feared, and in the grounds
of the Casino a cholera hospital was erected in
anticipated need, under the direction of the Board
of Public Health, Egypt. Fortunately it was never
required, but it was ready for use, and would have
been staffed by the First Australian General Hospital.</p>

<p>The final result, then, of all these expansions was
as follows. The 520-bed hospital which landed in
Egypt on January 25 had expanded into:</p>

</div>

<p>Almost the whole of this work was undertaken by
the staff originally intended to manage a 520-bed
hospital, at all events until the latest developments.
Reinforcements did not arrive until June 15, and
even then they were not long available.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>To house the reinforcements of nurses two other
buildings were taken at Heliopolis: Gordon House,
opposite Luna Park, and the Palace of Prince Ibrahim
Khalim, on the outskirts of Heliopolis.</p>

<p>It will be noted that the greater part of the expansion
took place in the immediate vicinity of the
Palace Hotel. This step was alike deliberate and
necessary, for reasons that will be explained hereafter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Methods Adopted in Organising Hospitals</span></h3>

<p>The methods adopted in organising these hospitals
varied. In the first instance Lieut.-Col. Barrett
was deputed by the D.M.S. Egypt to seek for the
necessary buildings, and when these were approved
to negotiate with the owners respecting the rent.
This proceeding proved very tedious and difficult,
and in pursuance of a General Army Order another
and simpler plan was adopted by the appointment of
an arbitration commission under the chairmanship of
Sir Alexander Baird. To this commission the determination
of rent and compensation was referred
when the acquisition of the buildings received the
sanction of the Commander-in-Chief. It need hardly
be said that a good deal of tact was necessary in
these proceedings, and every attempt was made to
meet the wishes of owners with regard to the buildings
commandeered.</p>

<p>Up till June 15 the number of nurses available
was small, and it became quite obvious that, owing
to the rush of sick and wounded, and the hot weather,
some of the nurses would experience a breakdown.
Lieut.-Col. Barrett accordingly visited Alexandria,
and arranged with the Australian and
Egyptian branches of the British Red Cross Society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to take over and equip two buildings as Rest Homes.
These houses had been generously offered for this
purpose to Her Excellency Lady MacMahon, wife of
the High Commissioner for Egypt. One of these
buildings was a large house belonging to a distinguished
Egyptian and was situated in Ramleh,
not very far from the beach, and the other was
about eight miles from Alexandria at Aboukir Bay,
the site of Nelson's victory. The latter consisted
of a large seaside bungalow owned by Mr. Alderson,
with an excellently fitted house-boat anchored some
little distance from the shore.</p>

<p>The Australian Government undertook to pay for
the maintenance of the nurses in these homes, which
were placed under the management of a joint committee
of the two branches of the Red Cross Society,
under the presidency of Lady MacMahon. Nurses
were then sent to these homes for a week at a time,
and derived great benefit from the sea-bathing.
These vacations formed a welcome and healthy break
in work of excessive severity.</p>

<p>The following table indicates the dates of the
principal changes which took place in the First
Australian General Hospital.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Policy of Expansion</span></h3>

<p>It has frequently been said in criticism of the
Auxiliary Hospitals that it would have been better
to have taken over Shepheard's Hotel, or the Savoy.
Neither Shepheard's nor the Savoy (particularly
the former) is very suitable for hospital purposes,
since hotels containing a large number of small
rooms involve much labour, and consequently a large
staff, and the authorities were faced with the fact
that there was no staff available. Surgeon-General
Williams had cabled to Australia for reinforcements
long before the crisis, but the reinforcements did
not arrive until the middle of June. Clearly the
sound policy was to obtain buildings as close to
Heliopolis as possible, to administer them with a small
staff, and to use them as overflow hospitals. Shepheard's
or the Savoy would have required a very
large staff, and it was not existent. Even at
Helouan the employment of civilians as officers was
necessary in order to carry on. Arab servants were
extensively employed by reason of the shortage of
staff. They acted as menservants, sweepers, and
the like.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Motor Ambulances</span></h3>

<p>When the <i>Kyarra</i> arrived in Egypt the British
authorities did not possess any motor transport.
There were some motor ambulances belonging to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
New Zealand authorities and a few motor ambulances
which accompanied the hospitals on the <i>Kyarra</i>,
and which had been allotted to special units. It
became obvious, however, that units might be placed
in circumstances in which they did not require
their ambulances, and others in circumstances in
which they required more than their share; and
accordingly Surgeon-General Williams decided to
park the whole of these motor ambulances in two
garages, a major one at Heliopolis and a smaller
one at Ghezira, near No. 2 General Hospital. The
garage at Heliopolis held at least thirty motor ambulances.
It belonged to the Heliopolis Palace Hotel,
and was equipped and furnished with a repairing
plant at the expense of the Australian branch of
the British Red Cross. The Ghezira garage was dealt
with in like manner, and in addition the rent was
paid in the first instance by the Australian branch
of the British Red Cross. The organisation of
these garages involved considerable difficulty. The
drivers employed were not recruited by the Commonwealth
Government as belonging to the motor
transport, since there was not any motor ambulance
establishment, and they consequently only received
the ordinary private's pay. Furthermore promotions
were very difficult to effect. Nevertheless they saved
the position. For a long while Egypt was absolutely
dependent on these motor fleets for the removal of
the sick and wounded, British or Australian. The
work was excessive but the drivers responded
splendidly. Difficulties arose through different units
endeavouring to commandeer motor ambulances
for their own use. This was met by a decision of
the D.M.S. Egypt that ambulances were to be kept
in the garages, and telephoned for when necessary.
From the outset, the lack of runabout motors was
severely felt, and ambulances were frequently
employed for purposes which would have been
better effected by runabouts.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Arrival of the Sick and Wounded from the Front</span></h3>

<p>The end of April was reached. The bulk of the
forces had disappeared from Egypt, and their position
was only known by rumour; the hospital was gradually
emptied of patients; Mena Camp had been abandoned,
and Maadi Camp was reduced to small proportions.
The weather was beautiful, and any one might have
been easily lulled into a sense of false security. On
April 28, however, a train-load of sick arrived. Its
contents were not known until it arrived at the Heliopolis
siding. The patients had come from Mudros,
and numbered over 200 sick, including some 60
venereal cases, a matter of some interest in the
light of subsequent events.</p>

<p>On the following day, however, without notice or
warning of any description, wounded began to arrive
in appalling numbers. On April 30 and May 1 and 2
no less than 1,352 cases were admitted at Heliopolis.</p>

<p>The expansion already indicated at Luna Park
was at once effected, and some relief was obtained
by transferring the lighter cases to Mena House&mdash;some
seventeen miles distant. The last train-load
of wounded arrived in the early morning of May 2,
and deserves special notice, as many of the men
were very seriously injured. There were about
100 cases; the train arrived at midnight, and was
emptied by 4 o'clock in the morning. The bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of the men badly injured was past praise. At
4 a.m. the main operating-room of the hospital
bore eloquent testimony to the gravity of the work,
which had been going on for many hours, and the
exhausted condition of the staff further demonstrated
what had occurred. The staff at the hospital
was quite inadequate to cope with the rush, notwithstanding
the willingness of every one concerned, and
accordingly volunteers from some of the Field Ambulances,
and from the Light Horse units which were
still in Egypt, were called for and readily obtained.
With the aid of the volunteers and by dint of universal
devotion to duty the work was done, and on
the whole done well.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Unloading the Hospital Train, Heliopolis Siding.</span><br />
<i>To face page 47</i></span>
</div>

<p>The proceeding adopted on arrival of the train
was as follows: Two officers were on duty on
the platform in control of guard and stretcher
squad. The officer in charge of the train handed
in a list of the number of wounded on the train,
classified into lying-down and sitting-up cases, those
of gravity being specially marked. The train was
then emptied carriage by carriage of the sitting-up
patients, who walked to the hospital or were driven
by the motor ambulances as the case might be, tally
being kept at the door of the carriage. As soon as
the train had been emptied of the sitting-up cases,
the cot patients were removed by the stretcher
squad to the motor ambulances, each of which
carried a load of two patients. In serious cases
an officer was sent with the patient, and as the
distance was less than a quarter of a mile, the
transfer was fairly rapid.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The Egyptian ambulance trains were on the whole
good, and were equipped with necessaries and comforts
by the Australian Branch British Red Cross.
The Australian military authorities also provided
nurses for the trains. The stretcher squads soon
learned and did their work exceedingly well; but
however well the work may be done, the removal of
a gravely injured man from a mattress in a wooden
bunk to a stretcher offers some difficulty and may
cause distress. The construction of the wooden
bunks left something to be desired. There is
no doubt that it is desirable to devise a carriage
of such a nature that stretchers can be inserted
without difficulty under every patient, and his
removal effected without disturbance.</p>

<p>The patients on arrival in the front hall of the
hospital were provided with hot chocolate and
biscuits, or with lime juice, and were at once
drafted to various portions of the hospital. The
lighter cases were sent to the auxiliary hospitals,
and the more severe cases transferred to wards
in the Palace building. Four sets of admitting
medical officers with staffs were in readiness, and
200 patients could be disposed of in an hour.
Promptitude was essential, as the trains sometimes
followed on one another quickly. On admission
the patients were bathed and given clean pyjamas.
Their clothes and kit were sent to the Thresh
Disinfector to be sterilised before being passed into
the pack store.</p>

<p>Every patient on entering the hospital was provided
with pyjamas, shirt, two handkerchiefs,
socks, plate, knife, fork, spoon, mug, and slippers.
The Red Cross Society provided him with writing-paper
and envelopes, pencil, chocolate, nail brush,
soap, cigarettes, tooth powder, and tooth brush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>As the equipment of additional beds involved the
supply of all these articles, in addition to mattresses,
blankets, linen, towels, kitchens, cooking-utensils,
stoves, bedside tables, ward utensils, instruments,
drugs, and bandages, the strain on the Quartermaster's
department during this period of expansion was very
great. The supply and distribution of food to the auxiliary
hospitals occasioned considerable difficulty at the
beginning of the crisis, but was satisfactorily adjusted.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Auxiliary Hospitals</span></h3>

<p>As the patients became convalescent they were
moved to one of the auxiliary hospitals, and from
the auxiliary hospitals to one of the convalescent
hospitals at Helouan or Alexandria, and thence
either invalided or discharged to duty. As the
patients during transference to the auxiliaries were
conveyed in a motor ambulance, and when transferred
to Helouan or Alexandria were motored to
Cairo railway station under charge of a N.C.O., some
idea of the work thrown on the motor ambulance
corps and on the staff can be imagined.</p>

<p>So far all the auxiliary hospitals were regarded as
wards of the main hospital, and administered from the
main building&mdash;the only possible method of administration
at this juncture. It was generally believed
that the Dardanelles campaign would be of short
duration, and that Luna Park and the other auxiliary
hospitals would soon be closed. Consequently the
expenditure of much money on these auxiliaries
was deprecated. When, however, it became obvious
that the operations at Gallipoli might last a very
long time, and that in any event the troops
pouring into Egypt from Australia and elsewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
would require hospital accommodation, an entirely
new view of the matter was taken, and active steps
were taken to permanently equip the auxiliary
hospitals for more serious work. Of this equipment
something must now be said in detail.</p>

<p>At Luna Park the central lake was emptied and
drained, and was covered by an enormous shelter
shed provided by the Australian Red Cross. The
shelter with a modern kitchen provided by the
authorities formed the dining-room for the patients,
nearly all of whom were able to leave their beds.
In addition an excellent operating-room was built
in brick, barbers' shops were organised, and a canteen,
store, and numerous comforts in the way of
blinds, sunshades, punkahs, were provided. Ample
bath and latrine accommodation was added. As time
passed, the palm beds were gradually replaced by
metal beds, and the total number reduced to 1,000.
In the event of another emergency, beds can be again
provided, to the number of 1,650, but such a step
will only be taken in the presence of necessity.</p>

<p>Furthermore in the case of Luna Park and the
other auxiliary hospitals, the D.M.S. Egypt decided
that the feeding of patients should be effected by
contract, and the matter was therefore left in the
hands of a well-known caterer. A large amount of
Red Cross money was expended on the shelter sheds
and on a recreation hut managed by the Y.M.C.A.,
and Luna Park became an excellent open-air hospital.
It is the more necessary to draw attention to this
fact by reason of the adverse criticisms which have
been passed by those who have only a superficial
acquaintance with it. It will be sufficient to say
that up to November 1, 5,500 patients had passed
through it, and there had been only one death, and
that from anæsthetic. This remarkable result was
not altogether due to the fact that mild cases were
admitted, for latterly many major operations had
been performed, for appendectomy, etc., and according
to Colonel Ryan, Consulting Surgeon to the Force
in Egypt, all the operation cases had healed by first
intention. In fact Luna Park really represents the
triumph of the open-air method of treating patients in
a rainless country. The patients preferred it because
of the freedom the gardens gave them, but they
showed one peculiarity which could never have been
foreseen. The Australian soldier was not very fond of
chairs. He did not want to stay in the shelter sheds,
but preferred to spend much of his day lying in bed,
and had to be ordered away from it to effect any
change. It is not unnatural that men who have
been doing excessive physical work should prefer
physical rest when they can get it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<i>To face page 51</i></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>At No. 2 Auxiliary Hospital, the Atelier, similar
changes were made. The Red Cross provided shelter
sheds and a number of comforts. The Atelier was
certainly the easiest of the buildings to adapt, by
reason of the relatively small number of patients
and its spacious surroundings.</p>

<p>At No. 3 Auxiliary Hospital the building could not
accommodate more than 250 patients in any circumstances,
but two large tennis courts were covered
with matting and provided with a louvred roof. This
proceeding was followed by the erection of wooden
huts each of which constituted a ward of 50 beds.
These huts were placed in convenient relationship to a
central kitchen and other conveniences. The Sporting
Club thus became an excellent outdoor hospital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>The creation of the Infectious Diseases Hospital
at Abbassia is another instance of the importance
of prevision. It was organised by Major Brown
(who had already organised Luna Park and the
Atelier) as a hospital of 250 beds. By successive
squeezes, and by the erection of tents, the accommodation
was rapidly increased to 1,250 beds, and
was then insufficient although typhoid cases were
not admitted.</p>

<p>The work of extension was at first difficult,
but soon became quite simple because a considerable
number of officers and men became experienced in
the methods of effecting desirable results, and in the
art of adapting means in sight to the end desired.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Conversion of the Auxiliary Hospitals into Independent Commands</span></h3>

<p>Finally it became obvious that the mechanism was
becoming too complicated, <i>i.e.</i> that the administration
of all these hospitals from the Palace Hotel, and
the keeping of the records at the Palace Hotel,
had become impossible. It was accordingly decided
to separate them and make them independent commands.
This arrangement was completed about the
middle of August, but it involved a fresh crop of
difficulties. It was quite necessary that some one
should meet the trains and allot the patients to the
various hospitals. That was a comparatively simple
matter. It was necessary that the hospitals should
be properly staffed, and that those who administered
them should receive proper rank, in other words
that there should be a definite establishment. This
necessitated a reference to the Australian Government,
and consequently difficulties and delays.</p>

<p>Surveying in retrospect this anxious and troublesome
period, the outstanding feature is the mistake
made in the constant assumption that the hospital expansion
was temporary. It was stated that Luna
Park would only be wanted for a few weeks; the
Dardanelles campaign would soon be over, Luna
Park would not then be wanted, and could be
closed, consequently heavy expenditure on it was
deprecated. Furthermore the experience gained
makes it obvious that in war the Service cannot
include too many medical officers&mdash;preferably juniors.
The demand for their services here and there is
practically unlimited. They should be young and
unattached to any particular unit&mdash;in fact a junior
reserve on the spot.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that the expansion of
No. 1 Australian General Hospital was effected under
the personal direction of the officer commanding,
Lieut.-Colonel Ramsay Smith, who inspected all
new buildings, gave his approval or disapproval,
and was responsible for their efficient equipment
when converted into hospitals.</p>

<p class="center"><big><b>CHAPTER V</b></big></p>


<p>It will be remembered that so far as the Australian
troops were concerned, provision had been made for
three convalescent hospitals or homes. The magnificent
hotel of Al Hayat at Helouan was taken
over on May 5, emptied of hotel furniture, fitted
with palm beds and mattresses, and converted into
a convalescent hospital. As there was no staff
in Egypt available, it was placed under the
direction of a military commandant and a principal
medical officer who was a civilian practitioner
resident at Helouan. A few non-commissioned
officers and orderlies were transferred to it from the
convalescent camp in the desert at Zeitoun, which
was very properly terminated. The cooking was
effected by arrangement with a professional caterer
at a charge of 5<i>s.</i> a day for officers, and 3<i>s.</i> a day for
men. These charges ultimately included the provision
of cooking and eating utensils. This convalescent
hospital both in its general character and with respect
to the food supplied represents in all probability the
most successful effort made in Egypt. In fact it
has been suggested that the hospital was almost too
attractive, and that there was consequently a good
deal of disinclination to leave it. In favour of the
principle involved in installing a military commandant
to administer a convalescent hospital there
is much to be said, as the administration is one
man's work.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Egyptian Climate</span></h3>

<p>Those who know Helouan and
the hotel will not be surprised
at the success of the Hospital,
but it may surprise even those
who know Egypt to learn that
Helouan is considerably cooler
than Cairo, notwithstanding
the fact that it is situated
on the edge of the desert.
Owing to dryness the Wet Bulb
temperature is considerably
lower than at Cairo in midsummer
and the nights are
always cool.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that
the figures in the attached table
give means only, and that any
registration over 75°F. Wet
Bulb is high, and that at 80°F.
Wet Bulb work becomes difficult.
At 90°F. Wet Bulb the
danger point is reached, and
all work must cease on pain
of death from heat apoplexy.
</p>

<p>It will be seen, then, that
Egypt is not especially hot,
even from May till October,
and that Helouan is particularly
cool. These conclusions
coincide with the feelings of
those who live there. Alexandria
is pleasant by day, because
of the sea breezes, but at night most people prefer
Heliopolis, which is drier and where they are more
likely to enjoy a breeze.</p>

<p>These observations apply to the weather after
May. From March to May the khamsin may blow
for several days. The temperature then is high,
but the air very dry. Khamsins usually cease
in May.</p>

</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Convalescent Hospitals</span></h3>

<p>The Ras el Tin Convalescent Hospital at Alexandria
was organised on similar principles to those
adopted at Al Hayat, for those who required seaside
change and sea bathing. At a later period half the
accommodation in the Montazah Convalescent Hospital
was rendered available to Australians. The
Montazah Hospital will be described under the
heading of Red Cross.</p>

<p>By the use of these three convalescent hospitals,
accommodation was provided for 1,500 patients, but
in case of necessity at least another 800 could
have been accommodated. In addition a large
convalescent camp was erected at Zeitoun in case
of emergency. After the engagement in August,
a very great rush of wounded was expected, and
had the hospitals and convalescent homes been
really taxed the convalescent camp would have been
utilised for overflow purposes. Fortunately this did
not become necessary, but the experience of May
had given sufficient warning of possibilities.</p>

<p>The normal progress, then, of a patient admitted
to No. 1 General Hospital suffering from a serious
wound or a serious disease of non-infectious character
was removal to one of the auxiliary hospitals when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
reached the semi-convalescent stage, and removal
to one of the convalescent hospitals when he reached
the convalescent stage. From these hospitals he
was discharged to duty.</p>

<p>Now, Helouan is twenty miles from Cairo, and can
be reached by railway or motor ambulance; and the
railway station in Cairo for Helouan is eight miles
from Heliopolis. As the patients were moved from
Heliopolis to Helouan in scores or even hundreds
at a time, some idea of the tax imposed on the motor
ambulance corps can be imagined. During the crisis
of May, June, and July, a visitor could witness an
eternal procession of trains discharging wounded at
Heliopolis, of trains discharging wounded at Cairo for
other hospitals, of sick being moved to and from
the different hospitals in Cairo, and convalescents
from the various hospitals being sent to the Cairo
station for Alexandria or to the Bab el Louk station
for Helouan. Without an adequate supply of
motor ambulances such an organisation would have
been impossible.</p>

<p>It should be understood that the convalescent
hospitals were available not only to all Australian
sick and wounded from any hospital, but also to
British or New Zealand sick and wounded. The
adjustment of accounts between the separate
Governments was a matter of discussion, and it was
finally agreed that in the case of hospitals no charges
should be made by reason of the section of the force
to which the sick or wounded man belonged. It
was desirable as far as practicable to send the Australians
to Australian hospitals, but if the treatment
of the sick and wounded necessitated it, no hard-and-fast
distinction was to be observed. In the case,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
however, of convalescent hospitals, in which the
matter could be dealt with in a more leisurely way,
the respective Governments were charged the cost
of maintenance of soldiers belonging to them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Army Medical Administration</span></h3>

<p>When the <i>Kyarra</i> arrived in Egypt the military
medical arrangements in that country were on a
very small scale, and under the administration of the
D.M.S. they rapidly enlarged. But the unexpected
rush on April 29 found the British Medical Force
to a considerable extent, and justly, dependent on
the Australian Force for hospitals, medical officers,
nurses, transport, specialists, and Red Cross stores.
As there is really only one service and one object in
view, it is quite unnecessary to emphasise the satisfaction
felt by Australians in being of substantial
service at a critical time. Since then the development
of the medical services has steadily proceeded,
and the anxiety of May, June, and July is never
likely to be experienced again.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Discipline</span></h3>

<p>A word must be said on the subject of discipline
and its influence on Australians. The bravery and
resourcefulness of Australians in the field are sufficiently
attested by those competent to judge. Of
their splendid behaviour when desperately injured
we have had ample evidence, which we furnish
with proper respect to brave men.</p>

<p>The convalescent Australian presents another
problem, as also does the soldier waiting at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
base. The lines in Dr. Watts's hymn come to mind.
In these circumstances his very fine qualities cause
him to give trouble. His ingenuity in breaking
bounds is worthy of a better cause.</p>

<p>For example, there were complaints from the military
police that sick men were roaming about Cairo
at night. The roll was called at No. 1 General
Hospital several times, and no one was absent. Not
quite satisfied, we called the roll in the Ophthalmic
Ward one evening at 8 p.m. Only one man was
absent. Still suspicious, we called it again at
8.40 p.m. the same evening, and twenty-one men
had gone. Some had rolled up coats or blankets
and so placed them that it seemed that the men
were still in bed. Subsequently uniforms that should
have been in the pack store were discovered under
their mattresses.</p>

<p>These and similar difficulties were aggravated by
the fact that even a moderate disciplinarian did
not always receive the support of the nurses or even
the medical officers.</p>

<p>To illustrate: An endeavour was made to limit
smoking in the wards to reasonable hours, as it has
become an unfortunate tradition that a sick soldier
may smoke cigarettes all day long, when in bed,
without injury.</p>

<p>One of us (J. W. B.) entered a small ward which was
filled with smoke, and was just in time to see a sick
man practically blowing smoke into a nurse's face;
needless to say the cigarette vanished with astonishing
rapidity. Looking through the murky atmosphere,
I asked the nurse whether she had seen any one smoking,
to which she unblushingly replied, "No, sir."</p>

<p>If nurses and a section of officers throw their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
weight against enforcement of discipline, because
they don't think it necessary or right, the difficulties
become considerable.</p>

<p>Again, the sentries were often in collusion with
the men. Two instances suffice: A soldier got out
of the hospital through a hole in the fence. On
returning he determined to test the sentry with an
eye to future escapades. Walking up to the gate, he
said, "I want to visit a friend." "Have you got a
pass?" said the sentry. "No," replied the sick
man. A discussion followed, and finally the sentry
said, "Go in and out by the hole in the fence; it will
save me a lot of trouble."</p>

<p>Yet another amusing incident. Sitting on the
great Piazza at Heliopolis were a number of men
convalescent from serious illness, pneumonia and the
like.</p>

<p>A short distance away on the outside of the iron
railing fence, the Arabs were conducting illicit and
prohibited trade with the men inside, and a sentry
appointed to prevent it was walking up and down
studying astronomy.</p>

<p>The Commanding Officer witnessed the occurrence,
visited the happy scene, interrogated the sentry,
and asked him what his duties were. The sentry
answered, "To walk up and down here with me gun
to prevent them prisoners" (the unfortunate convalescents)
"coming down them steps, and to prevent
them niggers jumping the fence!"</p>

<p>The hardest part of military work is waiting. The
soldier who has the magnificent fundamental qualities
of the Australian, and who can wait and obey,
would be the greatest soldier on earth. We are
hopeful that the experience gained will render the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Australian the claimant for this coveted position.
All thoughtful Australian officers we know tell the
same story: "Give us discipline, and again and
again discipline."</p>

<p>There is much to be said for the soldier. He will
obey if he knows why an order is given, or if he trusts
his officer and knows why it is given. But if he is
uncertain on these points he pleases himself. Discipline
cannot be enforced in general, except by
properly trained professional officers.</p>

<p>Again, there was more drunkenness than there
should have been from the same cause. One evening
visitors passed liquor into hospital, and a hideous
din arose. On seeking the cause, I discovered
it to proceed from a ward containing three patients,
of whom one had a broken leg and another a
broken arm.</p>

<p>These two men were uproariously drunk, and
were sitting up in bed making Australian political
speeches. On my entry he of the broken leg demanded
in broken tones to be at once paraded before
the orderly officer.</p>

<p>On another occasion a particularly nuggety
patient had broken the rules, and becoming troublesome
was ordered back to his ward. Refusing to go,
the guard was sent for, and a fight of a desperate
character ensued before he was overpowered;
yet we found accidentally that later on this man
was made a N.C.O. and apparently gave satisfaction.</p>

<p>In other armies such an offence might have been
punished with death.</p>

<p>On reading the account of the life of Stonewall
Jackson it is clear that similar difficulties were experienced
with the Confederate soldiers, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Jackson against his inclination was compelled to
enforce grave penalties at times to prevent still
graver trouble.</p>

<p>It takes several men on the lines of communication
and at the base to keep one man at the front, and only
loyal obedience to orders during the wearisome and
exacting day's work on the lines of communication
will make the machine run smoothly, and do justice
to the man in the line of battle who is risking his
life.</p>

<p>Yet it seems to us there is much to be done by
attention to the soldiers' social wants. The work
of the Y.M.C.A. and the provision of soldiers' clubs
were powerful influences in favour of good order and
conduct.</p>

<p class="center"><big><b>CHAPTER VI</b></big></p>


<p>It became evident, both during the crisis and before
the expected attack in August, that Egypt must be
cleared of those who were not likely to be fit for
service in the immediate future. The necessary
effort made to send invalids away for change, and
to send the permanently disabled home, involved
important questions of policy the determination of
which took time. A number of problems at once
obtruded themselves. Who was to be permanently
invalided, and how was the determination to be
reached? Who was to be sent away temporarily,
and for how long was he to go? Where was he to
be sent to? What was to be done with malingerers,
of whom there was a small but sufficiently numerous
percentage? As regards the first question: is a man,
for example, who has lost an eye permanently invalided?
Is he fit for base duty in Egypt, or must he
be sent home? It is hardly fair to send him to the
front and expose him to the risk of total blindness.
In this particular case, in view of the possibilities
of the development of ophthalmia in Egypt&mdash;which,
by the way, did not prove nearly as serious as was
anticipated&mdash;it was decided that the man who had
lost one eye should be sent home as permanently
unfit. Men who had lost a limb were put in the same
category. It might be argued that such men were
quite fit for clerical work, and that one-eyed men
were quite fit for ordinary guard work, for which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
indeed, the demand was overwhelming. The view
already indicated, however, was taken, and these
men were sent to their homes to be discharged.
But when these definite and obvious cases were
disposed of, there remained some thousands of men
whose cases were full of difficulty. In each hospital
Boards were accordingly appointed to investigate
their cases and to fully answer the questions set
out in the following Army Form B 179.</p>

<h3>OPINION OF THE MEDICAL BOARD</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Notes</span>.&mdash;(<i>i</i>) Clear and decisive answers to the following
questions are to be carefully filled in by the
Board, as, in the event of the man being invalided,
it is essential that the Commissioners of Chelsea
Hospital should be in possession of the most reliable
information to <span class="smcap">ENABLE THEM TO DECIDE UPON THE
MAN'S CLAIM TO PENSION</span>.</p>

<p>(ii) Expressions such as "may," "might," "probably,"
etc., should be avoided.</p>

<p>(iii) The rates of pension vary directly according
to whether the disability is attributed to (<i>a</i>) active
service, (<i>b</i>) climate, or (<i>c</i>) ordinary military service.
It is therefore essential when assigning the cause
of the disability to differentiate between them (<i>see</i>
Articles 1162 and 1165, Pay Warrant, 1913).</p>

<p>(iv) In answering question 20 the Board should
be careful to discriminate between disease resulting
from military conditions and disease to which the
soldier would have been equally liable in civil life.</p>

<p>(v) A disability is to be regarded as due to climate
when it is caused by military service abroad in climates
where there is a special liability to contract
the disease.</p>

<p>20. (<i>a</i>) State whether the disability is the result of
(i) active service, (ii) climate, or (iii) ordinary
military service.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) If due to one of these causes, to what specific
conditions do the Board attribute it?</p>

<p>21. Has the disability been aggravated by&mdash;</p>

<p>
(<i>a</i>) Intemperance?<br />
(<i>b</i>) Misconduct?<br />
</p>

<p>22. Is the disability permanent?</p>

<p>23. If not permanent, what is its probable minimum
duration?</p>

<p><i>To be stated in months.</i></p>

<p>24. To what extent is his capacity for earning a full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
livelihood in the general labour market lessened
at present?</p>

<p><i>In defining the extent of his inability to earn a livelihood,
estimate it at &frac14;, &frac12;, &frac34;, or total incapacity.</i></p>

<p>25. If an operation was advised and declined, was
the refusal unreasonable?</p>

<p>26. Do the Board recommend&mdash;</p>

<p>
(<i>a</i>) Discharge as permanently unfit, or<br />
(<i>b</i>) Change to England?<br />

</blockquote>

<p>It should be remembered that the bulk of the medical
officers were civilians, that they were unaware
of the broad questions of policy involved, and that
they were inclined on principle to give a holiday to
a man who had been fighting, and even to believe
the stories told them by the malingerer. The reader
will therefore not be surprised to learn that a number
of men who were certainly not in a very bad way
were recommended for two, three, or six months'
change, or even for discharge. The proceedings of
the Board were reviewed by a responsible officer;
for a long time by Lieut.-Col. Barrett when acting
as A.D.M.S. on General Ford's staff. It was, however,
difficult to persuade any Board which had
once expressed their opinion to modify it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
almost impossible to get them to reverse it. If
their recommendations had been rejected altogether,
the conduct of the Service would have become
difficult. Under direction, an attempt was made to
modify the practice by appointing a permanent
Board in each hospital, presided over by a senior
medical officer charged with the duty primarily of
attending to Board work, and of acting as a clinician
only when he had time.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Following Draft was made the Basis
of the Arrangement</span></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>1. Two medical officers are to be detached from
other duties at Nos. 1 and 2 Australian General
Hospitals respectively, in order to form a majority
of a permanent invaliding board at each hospital.
They will be known as the senior and junior invaliding
officer respectively.</p>

<p>2. The duties of the Board at Nos. 1 and 2 Australian
General Hospitals will be to form an Invaliding
Board by meeting in each case the medical officer
in charge of the case.</p>

<p>3. The Board proceedings when completed will be
sent to the A.D.M.S. Australian Force, Headquarters,
Cairo, and on being approved will at once be forwarded
with nominal roll to the Australian Intermediate
Base Depot, Cairo.</p>

<p>4. The Australian Intermediate Base will forward
to the O.C. Hospital or Convalescent Home nominal
roll of patients who are to be discharged or transferred
to Australia or England. These patients will
be transferred to the Convalescent Home, Helouan
(if they are able to leave hospital), and will remain
at the Home till transport is ready for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>5. The only circumstances in which completed
Board cases are to be retained in any hospital,
except the Convalescent Home, Helouan, are when
patients require a considerable amount of treatment,
and are unfit to leave the hospital.</p>

<p>6. The senior invaliding officer will be responsible
for the accuracy of the nominal rolls.</p>

<p>7. At Alexandria an invaliding officer will be
attached to the Australian Convalescent Home at
Ras el Tin. It will be his duty, under direction of
the A.D.M.S. Alexandria, to proceed to the various
hospitals and camps in Alexandria, arrange for the
formation of Boards, of which he will be a member,
to deal with all cases in Alexandria. These cases,
in like manner, must be forwarded to Convalescent
Home, Helouan, except in the cases of those who are
unfit to leave hospital.</p>

<p>8. The cases to be dealt with fall into two classes:
(<i>a</i>) men unfit for military service, who may be sent
by (i) transport to Australia or (ii) by hospital ship
to Australia; and (<i>b</i>) men likely to profit by change
to England during hot weather, to proceed by (i)
transport or (ii) hospital ship.</p>

<p>9. The Board proceedings are to indicate, in the
opinion of the Board, the best manner of dealing with
patients under the several headings.</p>

<p>
<i>June 30, 1915.</i><br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again difficulties arose, since none of the medical
officers wanted the job. In fact, medical officers in
general never want to do anything except attend
to patients. They are unsuited temperamentally
for administrative work, and dislike it. Even
with this modification, though the system worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
somewhat better, evils obtruded themselves. The
statements of men who swore they were suffering
from rheumatism and severe pains in the back were
sometimes taken at face value, and further modification
consequently became necessary. Any medical
officer could recommend any patient to be boarded.
The Board then sat and sent in its report to the
A.D.M.S. Under the modified arrangement no
patient could be boarded until he had been examined
by the senior medical officer of the Australian Force
in Egypt, or by the D.D.M.S. Egypt, Col. Manifold.
By this means most of the trouble was eliminated
and a satisfactory principle was established. It is
the old story&mdash;the reversion to direction by a limited
number of experienced and responsible people.</p>

<p>It was decided not to send Australian patients to
Great Britain other than in exceptional cases, that
is if they had friends or relatives there, and if
they only required a short change, say two months.
As the voyage to Australia occupied a month each
way, it was absurd to send them back there for two
months. For three months or more they were sent
to Australia, and in some cases were discharged on
arrival. Some men who were no longer fit for service
at the front were kept in Egypt for Base Duty.</p>

<p>Only those who have experience of base work
become aware of the enormous demands made on a
garrison for guard work, for clerical work, orderly
work, and the like. At Al Hayat, Helouan, for
example, the commandant really required ninety
men for sentry work, though he had only forty.
The demands for competent clerks were incessant.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a href="images/i113.jpg"><img src="images/i113-t.jpg" width="400" height="222" alt="" /></a><br />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Eastern Mediterranean</span>.<br />

<i>To face page 77</i></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as patients were destined for dispatch
to Australia they were forwarded to Helouan
and kept there until the ship was ready to
leave. As a result Helouan was filled with waiting
cases. In order then to ease the pressure at
Helouan, a waiting camp was established at Suez
close to the Government Hospital, to which any
patients could be admitted. This establishment of
course necessitated further demands for medical
officers, orderlies, etc.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Transport of Sick and Wounded by Sea</span></h3>

<p>As soon as it was decided to return patients to
Australia in addition to those sent to England,
Cyprus, or convalescent hospitals in Egypt, a system
was developed in order to provide the necessary
staffs and equipment on ships. Surgeon-General
Williams had exerted himself to get hospital ships
provided, but in the early stages they had not even
been promised, and a service was perforce created
by utilising empty transports and collecting the staff
in Egypt. The first efforts may be described as almost
maddening. It was impossible to get adequate
notice when a ship was likely to leave for Australia.
It had probably been to the Dardanelles and unloaded
soldiers and munitions of war. It had returned to
Alexandria packed with wounded. It might then
be drafted to Australia, at a few days' notice.
It was necessary to clean and refit it, to place hammocks,
blankets, beds on board, to provide drugs
and surgical appliances and Red Cross stores, and
to provide a staff in Egypt.</p>

<p>In looking back on the efforts made, the wonder
is not that minor defects occurred in the early stages,
but that the work was done anything like as well as
it was. The difficulties were almost insuperable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and nothing but the devotion of a number of medical
officers to the service rendered any decent result
possible.</p>

<p>The first ship to leave with wounded on board was
the <i>Kyarra</i> on June 7, but previously a number of
ships had left containing invalids, venereal cases,
undesirables, and oddments. In every case there
was a scramble at the last moment to get things
ready. The staff for the ships was provided by
detailing officers, nurses, and orderlies from the
scanty staffs of Nos. 1 and 2 General Hospitals.
The Australian Government, under request, then
began to provide transport staffs who came with
the troopships and returned at later intervals
when the troopships went back again as "hospital
carriers." Of hospital ships proper there were none.
Each ship was inspected in order to ascertain the
number of patients she could carry, and to determine
the staff requisite&mdash;consequently a routine
procedure was adopted. Cot cases were seldom
taken, as it was thought better where possible to
keep cot cases in Egypt. A minimum of two
medical officers was allowed for 300 patients, and
an additional medical officer for every 150 patients.
One trained nurse was allowed for every 50 patients,
and one orderly for every 25 patients. These numbers
were arbitrary and approximate, but served
as a working basis. The supply was probably in
excess of real requirements, but it was necessary
to contemplate the possibility of an epidemic outbreak
in the tropics and the grave results which
might ensue. The equipment of drugs and instruments
was liberal, and was arranged on a fixed
plan worked out by the officer in charge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
base medical store at Heliopolis. The Red Cross
stores were supplied in the same way, and the commanding
officer was given a sum of money, sometimes
as much as £150 to £200, to spend on comforts for
the men. A canteen was placed on board in addition.
The ship was not allowed to leave the wharf
until the commander had given a certificate that he
had on board all the medical comforts required by
the Admiralty regulations, and until the principal
medical officer had given a certificate that he had all
that he required in the way of staff, drugs, surgical
and medical equipment, and Red Cross stores.</p>

<p>There is no more dangerous branch of medical
service than the transport of sick and wounded over
the ocean, since there are so many possibilities
of disaster.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Base Medical Store</span></h3>

<p>These continual demands on personnel and on
medical stores necessitated suitable arrangements,
and messages were sent to Australia asking for
reinforcements. In addition a large base medical
store was established at Heliopolis, and made an
independent unit. It became the business of the
officer in charge of this store, Captain Johnson,
to make up drugs and surgical instruments per
100 patients, and to receive the surplus stores
from each of the incoming transports. Two hospital
ships were ultimately provided, the <i>Karoola</i> and the
<i>Kanowna</i>, and reached Egypt in October.</p>

<p>The arrangements for conveying the invalids from
Cairo to Suez were interesting. They could not
be conveyed to Alexandria or Port Said because one
passenger placed on a ship
at those ports enormously
increased the charges made
by the Suez Canal Company,
and Suez was consequently
fixed upon as
the port of departure and
the port of equipment.
Patients to be conveyed
to Suez were at Helouan,
or at different hospitals
in Cairo, and accordingly
two trains were made up&mdash;one
at Helouan and one
at Palais de Koubbeh, Heliopolis.
Each train was
filled at a specific time, the
two trains conveyed to
Cairo, a junction effected
in the Cairo station, and
the whole conveyed to
Suez. The journey took
about five hours, and the
necessary provision was
made for feeding the men
on the way. One of the
difficulties in conveying
such patients was to prevent
them riding on the
platforms of the carriages
and falling off. A sentry
was placed at each end of
the carriage to prevent
the continuance of these
disasters, which had been too numerous in the case
of healthy men in the troop trains. Men had even
lost their lives or been mutilated from trying to ride
on the buffers <i>à la Blondin</i>.</p>

<p>On arrival at Suez the train proceeded alongside
the ship, the patients and their kit were moved on
board, and a guard placed in the dockyard. Even
then men straggled into Suez, and their recapture
gave some trouble. The Australian is essentially
a roamer.</p>

<p class="center"><big><b>CHAPTER VII</b></big></p>


<p>In civil practice we had long been aware of the fundamental
failing of the medical profession. Its members
operate in a community as individuals. They seek
to cure disease in general; they are conscientious
to a degree in the discharge of this duty, and they
give valuable personal advice respecting hygiene.
But of the prophylaxis of disease they have little
trained knowledge, and they are not seriously
interested. The prophylaxis of disease really implies
organised and co-operative effort, and can only be
effectively undertaken by those public-health officials
who are charged with it as a definite function. In
Australia at all events the inducements to enter the
public-health service as a profession are not very
great. The influence of the department is not very
far-reaching, and the prophylaxis of disease is still
in its infancy. One can foresee the time when
the number of practitioners per 100,000 of the
population will be fewer than at present, and the
number of public-health officials will be greater.
The transition from the one occupation to the other
will only take place when a much higher standard
of general intelligence prevails in the community.</p>

<p>What applies to civil life applies to a lesser extent
to an army, because the headquarters staff of an
army are as a rule excellently informed respecting
the risk run by neglect of sanitation. They understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
thoroughly that disease may do more harm
than battles, and that outbreaks permitted to get
out of hand are with difficulty controlled. In the
Australian Army, by reason of its necessarily
scratch nature, there was practically no instruction
in prophylaxis. It was certainly not acutely understood,
and the disastrous events which attended
the formation of camps in Victoria and elsewhere
show that the controlling authorities were either
not fully informed of the risks, or if informed,
did not understand the best plan of action. What
applied in Australia was true to a lesser extent in
Egypt, because Surgeon-General Williams and many
of the R.A.M.C. officers who controlled medical
operations in Egypt, and distinguished members
of the Indian Medical Service who were associated
with them, had been through a number of campaigns
in South Africa and elsewhere, and were aware both
of the risks and the difficulties. Consequently some
effort was made to avoid, or to minimise the effects
of, some of the disastrous outbreaks.</p>

<p>In March and April, before the arrival of wounded,
the number of cases in hospital was a source of
common comment amongst the medical officers,
who could not understand why healthy men under
service conditions, camped on the edge of a dry
desert, should be suffering from serious disease to
such an extent. The diseases were for the most
part measles, with its complications, bronchitis,
broncho-pneumonia, and a certain amount of lobar
pneumonia, infectious pleuro-pneumonia, and tonsillitis.
There were a few cases of cerebro-spinal
meningitis. The impression made on a physician
who had all the cases coming from the Heliopolis
camps under his control was that these diseases were
inordinately prevalent; but the following figures,
obtained from headquarters and forwarded to the
Government, show that while disease was more
extensive than it should be, it was not excessive.
Including venereal disease, the cases certainly did
not exceed 6 to 8 per cent. of the force.</p>

<p>(Report begins) "The following figures have been
obtained from the office of the D.M.S. Egypt. Owing
to the movement of troops out of Egypt, comparisons
are apt to be a little difficult to institute
with accuracy. Nevertheless the figures given substantially
indicate the position.</p>

<p>On February 15 there were 1,329 patients in
hospital. The number of sick and off duty in the
lines, but not in hospital, is not stated; but as it
amounted to 423 on February 1, and to 644 on
March 1, it may be assumed to be 500, which will
give a total of 1,829 sick and off duty on February 15.</p>

<p>On March 1, 1,737 men were in hospital, 644 off
duty and sick in the lines, or a total of 2,361.</p>

<p>On March 15, 1,429 were in hospital, 500 off duty
and sick in the lines, or a total of 1,929.</p>

<p>On April 1, 1,217 were in hospital, 495 sick and
off duty in the lines, or a total of 1,712.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>The totals, therefore, off duty on the dates specified
were:</p>

</div>

<p>It should be stated that the figures quoted above
would have been very much larger were it not that
a large number of men unfit for duty by reason of
venereal and other forms of disease have been
returned to Australia, and a considerable number
sent to Malta.</p>

<p>There have been returned to Australia by the
<i>Kyarra</i> on February 2, the <i>Moloia</i> on March 15,
the <i>Suevic</i> on April 28, and the <i>Ceramic</i> on May 4, a
total of 337 soldiers who were medically unfit for
various reasons, and 341 suffering from venereal
disease, or 678 in all. In addition about 450 were
sent to Malta. If these soldiers had been added to
the list of those reported sick and unfit for duty
daily, the number would have considerably exceeded
2,000. The estimate of 2,000 sick and unfit for duty
daily was studiously moderate, as pointed out in a
private letter to Colonel Fetherston at the time when
precise figures could not be immediately obtained.</p>

<p>It is gratifying to find that the amount of sickness
is diminishing and that the amount of venereal
disease, so far as can be ascertained, is also decreasing.</p>

<p>Strenuous efforts have been made by the A.M.C.
to attack both forms of inefficiency by dealing with
the causes, and with a view to avoiding future
troubles the D.M.S. Egypt has appointed a committee
of medical officers to inquire into the causations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of the outbreak. It is unlikely that the committee
can be very active just at present, because
of the prior claims on the time of all concerned owing
to the influx of wounded. At a later period it is
hoped that an exhaustive report will be furnished for
the benefit of future undertakings.</p>

<p>Most strenuous efforts have been made to limit
the amount of venereal disease. General Birdwood,
Commander-in-Chief of the New Zealand and
Australian Army Corps, has personally interested
himself in this question, and has through the O.C.
First Australian General Hospital arranged for
me to visit each troopship on arrival, all leave
being stopped from the transport until I have been
on board. The practice followed is to interview
the commanding officer and the officers of the
transports, to explain to them the gravity of the
position, and to ask each and all of them to use all
the influence he possesses with his men to deter
them from exposing themselves to the risk of contagion,
to draw their attention to the fact that on
the physical fitness of the individual man depends
the possibilities of success to the army, and to ask
for the loyal and enthusiastic co-operation of every
officer in work of such importance from a military
point of view, and the point of view of subsequent
civil life. The officers immediately parade the men,
address them, and convey to each of them a printed
message from General Birdwood. General Birdwood's
letter to General Bridges, written during
the early part of the stay of the Army in Egypt,
is handed to the Commanding Officer to be read
by him and his staff. There is no doubt that this
systematic procedure has drawn attention to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
gravity of the problem. It has always been responded
to loyally by the officers concerned, and it has certainly
limited the action of young and inexperienced
men on their first landing in an Eastern country.</p>

<p>Other steps were taken by Surgeon-General
Williams, who on arrival in Egypt called a conference
of senior medical officers to consider the
gravity of the venereal diseases problem.</p>

<p>It is satisfactory to find, notwithstanding the
amount of disease which has existed, and which,
while not excessive, is still heavy, that the mortality
has not been as serious as it might have been.
The mortality in No. 1 Australian General Hospital
for February and March was seventeen cases out of
a total of 3,150 admitted" (Report ends).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Enlistment of the Unfit and its Consequences</span></h3>

<p>Prior to the arrival of the wounded the medical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
service was inconvenienced by another circumstance.
Men were continually arriving with hernia, varix,
and other ailments which they had suffered from
before enlistment, and which had been overlooked
during the preliminary examination in Australia.
In one case a soldier suffering from aortic aneurism
arrived in Egypt, and similar instances might be
given. The examination of recruits in Australia
had been conducted by practitioners in country
towns and elsewhere, often under conditions highly
unfair to the practitioner. There is no doubt that
the Government would have been well advised to
have withdrawn a few men from private practice
altogether, paid them adequate salaries, and made
them permanent examiners of recruits. Experience
of war demonstrates most completely the folly of
sending any one to the front who is not physically
fit. It is apt to be forgotten that in warfare there
can be no holidays, or days off, and that the human
being must be at his maximum of physical efficiency,
and his digestion of the best. If his soundness
is doubtful it is better to keep him for base duty
at home, on guard duty at the base, or as an
orderly in the hospital. It is simply a waste of
money, and tends to the disorganisation of the
service, to send such people anywhere near the
fighting line. We made an attempt at one stage
to roughly calculate what the Australian Government
had lost in money by the looseness of official
examination. It was impossible to make an accurate
estimate, but the sum was great.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ophthalmic and Aural Work</span></h3>

<p>When one of us joined the hospital as oculist
and aurist and registrar (Lieut.-Col. Barrett) he was
informed that specialists were not required, but
apparently those responsible had formed no conception
of the excessive demands which would be
made on the ophthalmic and aural departments.
The first patient admitted to No. 1 General Hospital
was an eye case, and an enormous clinic rapidly
made its appearance. It was conducted somewhat
differently from an ordinary ophthalmic and aural
clinic, in that (by reason of the remoteness of
their camps) some patients were admitted for
ailments which would have been treated in the
out-patient department of a civil hospital. There
were usually from 60 to 100 in-patients and there
was an out-patient clinic which rose sometimes to
nearly 100 a day. It should be remembered that
these included few, if any, serious chronic cases, which
were at once referred back to Australia. The amount
of ophthalmic and aural disease was very great.
The figures subjoined show the extent of the work
done.</p>

<p>From the opening of the Hospital to September 30,
1915, the patients treated in the Ophthalmic and
Aural Department numbered as follows:</p>

<p>The distribution of disease is unusual. In the
course of a long and extensive practice one of us
(Lieut.-Col. Barrett) had not seen as many cases
of adenoids in adults as he examined in Egypt in
three months. It seemed that the irritation of the
sand containing organic matter caused inflammation
and irritation of the naso-pharynx. Of ophthalmia
there was a great deal. It was usually of the Koch-Weeks
variety, and gave way readily to treatment.
There were a few cases of gonorrh&oelig;al ophthalmia, two
of which arrived from abroad, and all of which did
well. After the arrival of the wounded, however,
a new set of problems made their appearance. A
limited number of men were totally blind, mostly
from bomb explosions, and a large number of others
had received wounds in one eye or in the orbit.
It soon became evident that an eye punctured by
a fragment of a projectile is almost invariably lost.
The metal is non-magnetic. It is usually situated
deep in the vitreous; it is practically impossible to
remove it even if the eye were not infected and
degenerate. A still more remarkable phenomenon,
however, made its appearance. If a projectile
enters the head in the vicinity of the eye, and does
not actually touch it, in most cases the eye is
destroyed. Whether from the velocity or the rotation
of the projectile, the bruising disorganises the
coats of the eye and renders it sightless. In all
such cases, if the projectile was lodged in the orbit,
the eye was removed together with the projectile.
The total number of excisions was thirty-six. In
no case did a sympathetic ophthalmitis make its
appearance. The eyes were not removed unless
the projection of light was manifestly defective. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
fuller account of the precise ophthalmic conditions
will be published elsewhere.</p>

<p>If the general physical examination of recruits
was defective, it is difficult to find suitable terms to
describe the examination of their vision. Instances
were not infrequent where men with glass eyes made
their appearance, and there were several recruits who
practically possessed only one eye. Spectacle-fitting
was the chief work, as many of the recruits required
glasses, mostly for near work, but sometimes for
the distance. Ultimately the War Office decided to
provide the spectacles. In such a war, it is impossible
to exclude recruits for fine visual defects,
still, men with only one eye can hardly be sent
to the front.</p>

<p>One remarkable instance occurred. A man suffering
from detachment of the retina had but one
effective eye. I gave directions that he should not
be sent to the front, but he eluded authority, and
reached Gallipoli, where he was hit in the blind eye
with a projectile. I subsequently removed the eye.</p>

<p>The work was excessive, but only one life was
lost, though on occasion the condition of some of the
sufferers was grave to a degree. One of the most
remarkable cases of injury was that of a man who was
struck below the left eye by a bullet which emerged
through the back of his neck, to the side of the median
line. The bullet in emerging tore away a large
quantity of the substance of the neck, leaving a hole
in which a fair-sized wine glass could have been placed.
He was a cheerful man, and sat up in bed propped
with pillows, because of the weakness of his neck,
and observed to a visitor "Ain't I had luck!" He
made an excellent recovery.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that there should have been so
much refraction work, and there is no doubt that a
working optician, <i>i.e.</i> spectacle maker, should accompany
every army. Men are often just as dependent
for their efficiency on glasses as on artificial teeth,
and in a war of this character cannot be rejected.</p>

<p>The acute inflammations of the middle ear were
of the most severe type, caused temperatures
rising to 103° F. and sometimes left men on convalescence
as weak as after a serious general illness.
The attacks were so vicious that the pathologist,
Captain Watson, sought for special organisms, but
found only staphylococcus. Probably the same group
of organisms which caused vicious pulmonary attacks
also caused these severe aural inflammations.</p>

<p>Before our arrival in Egypt malingerers in the force
who, having enjoyed a holiday trip to Egypt, wanted
to go home again, suddenly discovered that they
were blind or deaf. For a time the department was
fairly busy detecting the wiles of these men. When
they discovered, however, that they would be subjected
to expert examination, sight and hearing soon
returned. A number of devices were resorted to in
order to detect the fraud&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the use of faradisation,
blind-folding, and the like&mdash;and it was rarely
that the impostor escaped.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Other Diseases: Measles and its Complications;
Food Infections</span></h3>

<p>The danger run by an army from measles is very
great indeed, and at an early stage the position was
surveyed, and an attempt made to limit the trouble.
A cable message was sent to Australia, asking that
precautions should be taken against shipping measles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
cases or contacts. At Suez arrangements were made
with the Government Infectious Diseases Hospital
to admit any patients suffering from measles or infectious
diseases who might land with the recruits.
In such cases the clothing of the remaining recruits
was disinfected before they were allowed to proceed
to Cairo. In this way disease was kept out of
Egypt as much as possible. In the case of measles
it is not simply temporary disablement, but also the
complications and sequelæ which are to be feared.
The experience gained has made us converts to
the open-air method of treating such cases, at all
events in a rainless country like Egypt. Treated on
piazzas and in open spaces the cases seem to do better
than in hospital wards, and, as far as one can judge
without a critical examination, with a lower mortality.</p>

<p>The extent to which the troops suffered from measles
and other diseases was the cause of the appointment
of a committee to inquire into causation. The
committee made some inquiries, but owing to a set
of complications never completed its work. There
seemed, however, to be a consensus of opinion that
the use of the bell tent was objectionable, as it did
not ventilate readily, and that the habits of the men
contributed to these diseases.</p>

<p>The men were apt to visit Cairo, spend the evenings
in the cafés or theatres, ride home in the cold nights
in a motor car or tram, get to bed at the last moment
possible, and then turn out again for a hard day's
work. The opinion of the physicians was that the
drilling of men suffering from even a moderate cold
was a source of considerable danger. If to these
causes be added the neglect of the teeth on the part
of many of the men, some explanation may be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
for the presence of these diseases. Every effort was
made to instruct the men through the regimental
officers, and there is no doubt that as time went on the
quantity of this type of disease somewhat diminished.</p>

<p>Sunstroke was practically unknown. A number
of cases occurred during a severe khamsin, but the
use of a looser and lighter uniform, and the adoption
of sensible hours of work, prevented any recurrence.
Of two deaths known to have taken place the cause
was only partly due to heat. The men were warned
against the risk of bilharzia, and as they were
provided with shower baths there was no inducement
to bathe in the muddy pools and canals where
bilharzia lurks.</p>

<p>With the provision of dentists another risk was
removed, at all events in parts. In hospitals,
tooth brushes were supplied in thousands, and every
effort was made to get the men to use them.</p>

<p>As the summer wore on, however, another type
of disease made its appearance&mdash;the intestinal infections
which, at first unknown, became so frequent
in Gallipoli as to be more serious than fighting.
In Gallipoli itself it is difficult to see how they
could be prevented. In a limited space there were
many dead bodies scantily buried, and consequently
myriads of flies. The plentiful use of disinfectant,
had it been obtainable, might have been useful, but
the difficulties were great. Once the dysenteric
organisms were introduced, it was practically impossible
to stop the spread of disease.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Fly Pest</span></h3>

<p>At the Island of Lemnos, however, which was
not under fire, and where there was room, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
conditions appear to have been nearly as bad, and it
is somewhat difficult to know why the fly pest could
not have been got under at Mudros. At Heliopolis
at an early stage the fly problem was seriously
tackled. A sanitary officer was appointed, and
charged with the duty of dealing with this important
matter. The following precautions were adopted. All
refuse and soiled dressings were placed in covered
bins, which were provided in quantity. These were
removed once daily. Any moist ground in the
vicinity of these bins was watered with sulphate of
iron solution, and sprinkled with chloride of lime.
Fly papers in great numbers were distributed
throughout the wards. The food in the kitchens,
whether cooked or uncooked, was kept under gauze
covers or in gauze cupboards. By these means the
fly pest was reduced to small proportions. But
with the least slackness in administration the flies
were again in evidence. It was most instructive to
see a floor covered with flies if fluid containing food
material had been spilled, and to see dirty clothing
covered with masses of flies. A piece of soiled
clothing half buried in the desert appears to act as
an excellent breeding-place.</p>

<p>It was impracticable in Egypt to cover all the
windows and doors with fly-proof netting. The exclusion
of the air in the hot weather would have been
troublesome, and the best type of netting was not
obtainable. Furthermore the precautions already
enumerated kept the pest under in Heliopolis.</p>

<p>The fly problem was one of the most serious the army
had to face. The passage of a dysenteric stool by
a man who is really ill was often followed by the entry
into his anus of flies before an attendant had time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
to intervene. Each of these flies might then become a
source of infection and had only to light on a piece of
food, cooked or uncooked, to cause further damage.</p>


<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Circular issued by the Officer Commanding<br />
the Hospital</span><br />
<i>Destruction and Prevention of Flies</i>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Outside.</i></p>

<p>1. No rubbish heaps will be allowed.</p>

<p>2. All manure heaps shall be sprayed twice a

of water.</p>

<p>3. All food in the Arab quarters shall be kept

<p>4. All rubbish boxes and open receptacles shall
be removed from the premises and neighbourhood.</p>

<p>5. No receptacles other than iron tins with lids
kept closed will be allowed to be used for
refuse.</p>

<p>6. Every place on which garbage has been
exposed shall be freely sprinkled with chloriated
lime.</p>


<p><i>Wards.</i></p>

<p>1. All food and receptacles for food shall be
kept constantly covered.</p>

<p>2. All spit-cups shall be kept covered.</p>

<p>3. All remains of food shall be removed at once
to receptacles which are to be kept covered
completely and constantly except when uncovered
necessarily to receive waste materials.</p>

<p>4. Sisters-in-Charge shall use a liberal quantity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>of fly papers. Surgical soiled dressings
shall be placed in special bins which shall be

<p><i>Kitchen and Mess Rooms.</i></p>

<p>1. All food shall be kept locked up or completely
covered.</p>

<p>2. All remains of food shall be treated as in the
wards. The responsible officer shall use a
liberal supply of flat or hanging fly papers.</p></blockquote>

<p>It need hardly be said that the enforcement of
even these simple precautions is more difficult than
giving the order.</p>

<p>A good sanitary officer, however, acting on these
directions, can and did reduce the fly danger to
small proportions. The flies were never exterminated,
but were kept well under. The least
slackness, however, ended in their rapid reappearance.
As they are in all probability the principal
cause of the gastro-intestinal infections, the matter
is one of the first importance.</p>

<p>Typhoid fever made its appearance, and a proper
statistical investigation should be made later on to
show the extent of the damage done. The general
impression respecting the result of the inoculation to
which all the troops were subjected was that the
disease was not so frequent and certainly not nearly
so fatal as it otherwise would have been. Deaths
were few.</p>

<p>The men had not been inoculated against paratyphoid,
so that exact conclusions will be difficult
to draw even when figures become available.</p>

<p>Many people suffered from Egyptian stomach ache,
a form of disease which is as unpleasant as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
is exhausting. It manifests itself by repeated
attacks of colicky pain, apparently usually associated
with the colon. The severity of the pains is remarkable,
and the persistent recurrence speedily ends in
a considerable degree of exhaustion. It is almost
certainly due to food infection.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the business of a sanitary
medical officer is not merely to inspect buildings
and kitchens, but to spend an hour or two a day
in the kitchen quietly watching the preparation of
the food and giving the necessary instruction and
supervision to those who are preparing it. The
inefficiency caused by food infections has probably
done more harm than many battles. In the camps
similar troubles occurred. By reason of the lack
of cold storage and the high temperature, rotten
food was not uncommon, and caused outbreaks of
incapacitating diarrh&oelig;a and ptomaine poisoning.</p>

<p>When, however, the problem is surveyed dispassionately,
the remarkable feature of the work
at Heliopolis and in Cairo was the low mortality,
as the following table will show:</p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Burials in Old Cemetery, Cairo</span><br />
<i>From Arrival of Australians in Egypt, December 5,<br />
1914, to August 14, 1915</i>
</div>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">British Imperial Force</td><td align="right">77</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Australian Imperial Force</td><td align="right">155</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">New Zealand Force</td><td align="right">50</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In view of this extraordinarily low mortality, it
is interesting to comment on human intellectual
frailty. It was said that the hospitals were septic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
that operations of election could not be performed
with safety, that the climate was particularly dangerous,
and so forth. One letter which reached
us made reference to hundreds of deaths of brave
fellows due to faulty camp and hospital conditions.
Yet here is the fact recorded that the total deaths in
Cairo amongst Australians from disease and wounds
to August 14 were only 155. All men tend
to generalise on insufficient instances, and the
tendency in this case was aggravated by some
physical discomfort experienced by the generalisers
throughout an unusually warm summer&mdash;a discomfort
accentuated by overwork and a conscientious
devotion to duty under trying conditions.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Egyptian Climate again</span></h3>

<p>Dealing with the surgical side of the matter,
nothing was commoner at one time than to hear the
statement made that owing to the hot weather septic
infections were common, that wounds did not heal
as they should in Egypt, and that it was not a
suitable place to which wounded men should be
sent. While quite agreeing with the critics that a
cool climate is always preferable to a hot one, it may
be remarked that in the first place summer in Egypt,
apart from the khamsin, is not excessively hot.
The khamsin blows for a certain number of days in
April, May, and the first half of June. The temperature
may rise to 112° or more. The wind blows
with a fiery blast, and there is no doubt it is exceedingly
trying. But if buildings are shut up early in
the morning and opened at night, even the khamsin
may be made tolerable. After the middle of June,
however, there is very little wind. One day is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
like another. The midday temperature is from 90°
to 95° Dry Bulb, and the nights perhaps 65° to
70° Dry Bulb. The Wet Bulb temperatures are
set out in the table previously referred to.</p>

<p>For the most part men slept in nothing but
pyjamas. No sheet is wanted until towards the
end of August. Whilst it is not pleasant to wake
in the mornings in a lather, nevertheless, if a practical
and cold-blooded examination be made of the
facts, the result shows nothing but discomfort.</p>

<p>Grave septic diseases did not occur. The hospitals
were perfectly clean, and at Luna Park in
particular we have the testimony of Colonel Ryan
that the wounds healed by first intention and that
the cases did excellently.</p>

<p>As the garrison of Egypt was a very large one, and
as Australian troops were continually pouring into
it, it was impracticable even if it had been necessary
to take the patients anywhere else. The
islands of Lemnos and Imbros were far less suitable
even for those who had been injured at Gallipoli,
and apart from the inconvenience caused by the
heat there was no reasonable ground for complaint
in Egypt. Furthermore the heat is not tropical.
It is subtropical, as the Wet Bulb temperatures
indicate.</p>

<p>In the First Australian General Hospital every care
was taken to minimise the inconvenience; a very
large number of excellent ice chests were purchased,
an enormous quantity of ice was used,
and the necessary steps thus taken to diminish the
amount of food decomposition and prevent ptomaine
poisoning. Fans and punkahs were used, and the
nights were quite tolerable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Medical Organisation in Egypt</span></h3>

<p>When the Australian forces pass three miles from
Australian shores they cease, at all events technically,
to be under Australian control, and pass under
the control of the Commander-in-Chief. On arrival
in Egypt they passed under the control of General
Sir John Maxwell, G.O.C.-in-Chief, Egypt. The
medical section passed under the command of the
Director of Medical Services, Surgeon-General Ford.
The D.M.S. Australian Imperial Force, Surgeon-General
Williams, arrived in Egypt in February and
was placed on the staff of General Ford to assist
in managing these units. He left for London on
duty on April 25, and one of us (J. W. B.) was
appointed A.D.M.S. for the Australian Force in
Egypt on the staff of General Ford. Later, Colonel
Manifold, I.M.S., was appointed D.D.M.S. for
Australian and other medical units. Thus the
Australian medical units were under the same command
as New Zealand or British units, but with
separate intermediaries.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Risk of Cholera</span></h3>

<p>In view of the risk of cholera, the following note
by Dr. Armand Ruffer, C.M.G., President of the
Sanitary, Maritime and Quarantine Council of Egypt,
Alexandria, was issued and, later on, inoculation was
practised on an extensive scale.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dr. Ruffer's Views on Cholera</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>(Report begins) "The first point is that although,
in many epidemics, cholera has been a water-borne
disease, yet a severe epidemic may occur without
any general infection of the water supply. This was
clearly the case in the last epidemic in Alexandria.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Attention to the water supply, therefore, may not
altogether prevent an epidemic. The second point
is that the vibrio of cholera may be present in a
virulent condition in people showing no, or very
slight symptoms of cholera, <i>e.g.</i> people with slight
diarrh&oelig;a, etc.</p>

<p>The segregation of actual cases of cholera, therefore,
is not likely to be followed by any degree of
success, because this measure would not touch
carriers or mild cases, unless orders were given to
consider as contacts all foreign foes, and all soldiers
who have been in contact with them. This is clearly
impossible.</p>

<p>There cannot be any reasonable doubt, therefore,
that if the Turkish army becomes infected with
cholera, the British Army will undoubtedly become
infected also.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly inoculation is the cheapest and
quickest way of protection of the troops, provided
this process confers immunity against cholera.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to estimate accurately the protection
given by inoculation against cholera. My
impression from reading the literature on the subject
is that: (1) The inoculations must be done at least
twice. (2) The inoculations, if properly made, are
harmless as a rule. (3) The inoculations confer a
certain protection against cholera. I may add that
I arrived at this opinion before the war, when the
French editors, Messrs. Masson &amp; Co., asked me to
write the article "Cholera" for the French standard
textbook on pathology. My opinion was therefore
quite unprejudiced by the present circumstances.</p>

<p>The cholera inoculations were harmless <i>as a rule</i>;
that is, <i>they were not always harmless</i>. Savas has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
described certain cases of <i>fulminating cholera</i> amongst
people inoculated <i>during the progress of an epidemic</i>.
In my opinion, the people so affected were in the
period of incubation when they were inoculated,
and the operation gave an extra stimulus, so to
speak, to the dormant vibrio. One knows that,
experimentally, a small dose of toxin, given immediately
after or before the inoculation of the microorganism
producing the toxin, renders this microorganism
more virulent.</p>

<p>The conclusion to be drawn is that inoculations
should be carried out before cholera breaks out.</p>

<p>I am afraid I know of no certain facts to guide me
in estimating the length of the period of immunity
produced by inoculations. Judging by analogy, I
should say that it is certainly not less than six
months, that it, almost certainly, lasts for one year,
and very probably lasts far longer.</p>

<p>I understand that 90,000 doses of cholera vaccine
have been sent from London. I take it that the
inoculation material has been standardised and its
effects investigated, but, in any case, I consider that
a few <i>very carefully performed</i> experiments should
be undertaken at once in Egypt, in order to make
sure of the exact method of administration to be
adopted under present conditions.</p>

<p>Probably, a good deal may be done by the timely
exhibition of drugs, such as phenacetin, etc., to
mitigate the more or less unpleasant effects of
preventive inoculation.</p>

<p>As I am on this subject, may I point out the
necessity of establishing at the front a laboratory
for the early diagnosis of cholera and of dysentery.
Cholera has appeared in the last three wars in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Turkey has been engaged, and therefore the chances
of the peninsula of Gallipoli becoming infected are
great. The early diagnosis of cases of cholera,
especially when slight, is extremely difficult and often
can be settled by bacteriological examination only.</p>

<p>There never has been a war without dysentery,
and almost surely our troops will be infected in
time, if they are not already infected. But whereas
in previous wars the treatment of dysentery was
not specific, the physician is <i>now</i> in possession of
rapid methods of treatment, provided he can tell
what kind of dysentery (bacillary or am&oelig;bic or
mixed) he is dealing with.</p>

<p>This differential diagnosis is a hopeless task unless
controlled at every step by microscopical and bacteriological
examination.</p>

<p>The French are keenly aware of this fact, so much
so that they have sent, for that very purpose, three
skilled bacteriologists, two of whom are former
assistants at the Pasteur Institute, to the Gallipoli
Peninsula" (Report ends).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><span class="smcap">Other Infectious Diseases</span></h3>

<p>The Infectious Diseases Hospitals were filled mostly
with cases of measles and its complications, including
severe otitis media. Cases of erysipelas, scarlatina,
scabies, and diphtheria were met with in small numbers.
In the autumn there was a severe epidemic of mumps.</p>

<p>Through the summer and autumn many cases of
diarrh&oelig;a and of both am&oelig;bic and bacillary dysentery
made their appearance. There is good ground
for believing that many so-called diarrh&oelig;al cases
were dysenteric.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>There is little doubt short of absolute scientific
proof that the greater part of the intestinal diseases
are fly borne.</p>

<p>The following table shows the admissions into the
hospital, the deaths, and causes of death, to July 31,
1915.</p>

<p>The venereal-disease problem has given a great deal
of trouble in Egypt as elsewhere. The problem in
Egypt does not differ materially from the problem
anywhere else, but a number of fine soldiers have
been disabled more or less permanently.</p>

<p>When the First Australian Division landed in
Egypt and camped at Mena, the novelty of the surroundings
and the lack of intuitive discipline resulted
in somewhat of an outbreak, both with regard to
conduct and to sexual matters. Both of these phases
have been greatly exaggerated, but nevertheless there
was substantial ground for apprehension, and the
following letter from General Birdwood, Commander-in-Chief
of the Australian Army Corps, to
the officers commanding units was sufficient evidence
of the necessity for action.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">MY DEAR GENERAL</span>,</p>

<p>"You will, I know, not misunderstand me
if I write to you about the behaviour of a very small
proportion of our contingents in Cairo, as I know
well that not only you, but all your officers and non-commissioned
officers and nearly all the men must
be of one mind in wishing only for the good name of
our contingents.</p>

<p>"Sir John Maxwell had to write recently complaining
of the drunkenness of some of our men in
the Cairo streets. During Christmas time some small
licence might perhaps have been anticipated, but
that time is now over, and I still hear of many cases
of drunkenness, and this the men must stop.</p>

<p>"I advisedly say 'the men must stop,' because I
feel it is up to the men themselves to put a stop to
it by their own good feeling. I wonder if they fully
realise that only a few days' sailing from us our fellow-countrymen
are fighting for their lives, and fighting
as we have never had to do before, simply because
they know the very existence of their country is at
stake as the result of their efforts.</p>

<p>"We have been given some breathing time here
by Lord Kitchener for one object, and one object
only&mdash;to do our best to fit ourselves to join in the
struggle to the best advantage of our country. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
honestly do not think that <i>all</i> of our men realise
that this is the case. Cairo is full of temptations,
and a few of the men seem to think they have come
here for a huge picnic; they have money and wish
to get rid of it. The worst of it is that Cairo is full
of some, probably, of the most unscrupulous people
in the world, who are only too anxious to do all they
can to entice our boys into the worst of places, and
possibly drug them there, only to turn them out
again in a short time to bring disgrace on the rest
of us.</p>

<p>"Surely the good feeling of the men as a whole
must be sufficient to stop this when they realise it.
The breathing time we have left us is but a short
one and we want every single minute of it to try and
make ourselves efficient. We have to remember
too that our Governments of the Commonwealth
and Dominion have sent us here at a great sacrifice
to themselves, and they fully rely on us upholding
their good name, and indeed doing much more than
that, for I know they look to us to prove that these
two contingents contain the finest troops in the
British Empire (whose deeds are going down in
history), whom they look forward to welcome with
all honours when we have done our share, and I hope
even more than our share, in ensuring victory over
a people who would take all we hold dear from us
if we do not crush them now.</p>

<p>"But there is no possibility whatever of our doing
ourselves full justice unless we are every one of us
absolutely physically fit, and this no man can possibly
be if he allows his body to become sodden with drink
or rotten from women, and unless he is doing his best
to keep himself efficient he is swindling the Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
which has sent him to represent it and fight for
it. From perhaps a selfish point of view, too, but
in the interests of our children and children's children,
it is as necessary to keep a 'clean Australia' as a
'White Australia.'</p>

<p>"A very few men can take away our good name.
Will you appeal to all to realise what is before us,
and from now onwards to keep before them one
thought and only one thought until this war is
finished with honour&mdash;that is, a fixed determination
to think of nothing and to work for nothing but their
individual efficiency to meet the enemy.</p>

<p>"If the men themselves will let any who do not
stick to this know what curs they think them in
shirking the work for which it has been their privilege
to be selected, then, I know well, any backslidings will
stop at once&mdash;not from thoughts of punishments,
but from good feeling, which is what we want.</p>

<p>"I have just been writing to Lord Kitchener
telling him how intensely proud and well-nigh overwhelmed
I feel at finding myself in command of such
a magnificent body of men as we have here; no man
could feel otherwise. He will, I know, follow every
movement of ours with unfailing interest, and surely
we will never risk disappointing him by allowing a
few of our men to give us a bad name. This applies
equally to every one of us, from General down to
the last-joined Drummer.</p>

<p>"Will you and your men see to it?</p>

<div class="right">
"Yours very sincerely,<br />
"<span class="smcap">W. R. Birdwood</span>."<br />
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>Those who possessed any experience of life could
not but realise that 18,000 particularly vigorous fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
men, brought up in a country where discipline is conspicuous
by its absence, and landed for the first time
in a semi-eastern city such as Cairo, were likely to
behave in such a manner that a small minority
would get into trouble. Active steps were taken to
meet the difficulties, and to prevent recurrence of
the outbreaks when the Second Division and other
reinforcements arrived.</p>

<p>General Birdwood accordingly issued the following
circular:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="center">"<span class="smcap">Warning to Soldiers respecting Venereal Disease</span></div>

<p>"Venereal diseases are very prevalent in Egypt.
They are already responsible for a material lessening
of the efficiency of the Australasian Imperial Forces,
since those who are severely infected are no longer
fit to serve. A considerable number of soldiers so
infected are now being returned to Australia invalided,
and in disgrace. One death from syphilis
has already occurred.</p>

<p>"Intercourse with public women is almost certain
to be followed by disaster. The soldier is therefore
asked to consider the matter from several points of
view. In the first place if he is infected he will not
be efficient and he may be discharged. But the
evil does not cease even with the termination of his
military career, for he is liable to infect his future
wife and children.</p>

<p>"Soldiers are also urged to abstain from the consumption
of any native alcoholic beverage offered to
them for sale.</p>

<p>"These beverages are nearly always adulterated,
and it is said that the mixture offered for sale is
often composed of pure alcohol and other ingredients,
including urine, and certainly produces serious consequences
to those who consume it. As these drinks
are drugged, a very small amount is sufficient to
make a man absolutely irresponsible for his actions.</p>

<p>"The General Commanding the Australasian
Forces, therefore, asks each soldier to realise that
on him rests the reputation of the Australasian Force,
and he is urged at all costs and hazards to avoid the
risk of contracting venereal disease or disgracing
himself by drink."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This leaflet was entrusted to Lieut.-Col. Barrett
to deliver to troops on arrival, and he accordingly
visited Port Said and Suez, interviewed the officers
on the transports, and fully explained the position to
them. They were requested to use their influence
with the men in the direction of restraint. Subsequently
after the destruction of the <i>Konigsberg</i> the
transports began to arrive at irregular intervals and
it became impossible to meet the officers at the ports.
They were then interviewed at Abbassia or Heliopolis,
and later still by order of General Spens, G.O.C. Training
Depot, the men themselves were addressed on the
day of their arrival. The form of address was simple.
The dangers of infection were pointed out to them&mdash;particularly
as regards typhoid fever, dysentery,
bilharzia, and venereal disease. They were shown how
the first three diseases could be avoided. So far as
venereal disease was concerned they were informed
that the matter was in their own hands. They were
asked to imitate the Japanese, and by their own efforts
preserve their health with the same care that they
bestowed on their rifles or their ammunition, the
preservation of health and arms being equally important.
Passages from the famous rescript of the
Emperor of Japan before the Russian war were
quoted in which it was stated in substance that
if the normal proportion of sick existed in the
Japanese army defeat was a practical certainty; but
that if they followed the direction of their medical
officers and took the same care of their bodies as
they took of their equipment, the number of troops
saved thereby would make all the difference in the
ensuing conflict.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>General Birdwood asked for the whole-hearted
and enthusiastic co-operation of all officers in doing
their best to control their men, and to prevent
them from exposing themselves to the risk of
venereal disease. Some little time before the issue
of the circular 3 per cent. of the Force were affected
by venereal disease on any one day. Fortunately, as
a result of the efforts made, the tendency was to
diminution, but the amount of venereal disease was
still sufficiently great to give concern and anxiety.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the action of General Birdwood
prevented outbreaks and limited the amount
of disease. It is also equally true that in spite of
his efforts the amount of disease was too large to be
contemplated with equanimity.</p>

<p>The Venereal Diseases Hospital, Abbassia, was
nearly always full, but from time to time drafts of
men were sent back to Australia. One draft of 450
soldiers was sent to Malta early in the campaign. The
principle involved in the policy of returning them to
Australia was as follows. In Egypt they were
useless as soldiers, whether suffering from gonorrh&oelig;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
or syphilis. They required a large number of
medical men and attendants to take care of them.
They knew they had disgraced themselves and were
a source of trouble to every one concerned. On
shipboard they could not get into trouble. They
were more likely to be cured, and could then be
returned to Egypt, and if not cured could be treated
in Australia at leisure. Against this policy the argument
was used that diseases were being introduced
into Australia, but as a matter of fact a minority
of the men suffering from venereal disease brought
it from Australia to Egypt. They arrived at Suez
suffering from gonorrh&oelig;a contracted in some cases
at Fremantle. Furthermore the business of those
conducting the campaign was to wage a successful
war, and to keep the base as free from encumbrance
as possible. The total number returned to Australia
in this way was as follows:</p>

<p>From February to September 14, 1,344, and in
addition 450 were sent to Malta.</p>

<p>At first they were sent in ships with other cases
and sometimes segregated on board, but difficulties
arose at the Australian ports. The people who welcomed
the returned soldiers were sometimes enthusiastic
in greeting venereal cases by mistake, and
sometimes non-venereal cases were regarded with
suspicion because they came from a ship known to
convey venereal patients. It was finally decided
by the Australian Government that venereal cases
should be conveyed in ships by themselves, the first
consignment of 369 being sent in the <i>Port Lincoln</i>.</p>

<p>A certain number of the gonorrh&oelig;al cases recovered
and became fit for service, but too often
they relapsed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>The authorities were fully alive to the damage
which was being done, and persistent and earnest
attempts were made to deal with it from many
different points of view. General Maxwell issued
an order prohibiting the sale of drink after an early
hour (10 p.m.) in the evening, and also prohibiting
soldiers from being found in Cairo after an early
hour. There is no doubt that both of these directions
proved to be of considerable value.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Moral Conditions in Cairo</span></h3>

<p>Something must be said, however, about the moral
conditions in Cairo, about which exaggerated and
perverse notions seem to be entertained. Cairo, like
all large cities in the world, possesses its quota of
prostitutes, who differ only from prostitutes elsewhere
in that the quarters are dirtier and that the women
are practically of all nationalities, except English.
The quarter in which they live is evil-smelling, and
is provided with narrow streets and objectionable
places of entertainment. It contains a considerable
infusion of Eastern musicians and the like, and is
plentifully supplied with pimps of the worst class.
These men were promptly dealt with by the police,
the authorities giving the most sympathetic assistance
to the military.</p>

<p>As in other countries, there were graduations in
the class of women employed, and the personal impression
gained by the authorities was that the
danger of infection was greatest from those at the
top and the bottom of the social scale. Prostitutes
who were registered were examined by a New Zealand
gynecologist, who did the work very thoroughly,
and conscientiously, and with kindness. Women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
who were free from disease were furnished with
a ticket indicating that they were healthy. At
the beginning of the war there were 800 of these
women in Cairo, but as the war progressed the number
grew to 1,600. The arrangement then differed
in no way from the arrangements in Melbourne or
Sydney except that the surveillance of the police was
direct, and medical examination was insisted upon.
It further had this advantage over those of Melbourne
and Sydney, that the women were confined
to one particular part of the city, and no one need
come in contact with them unless they wanted to.
Consequently for those who went to this quarter
there is no excuse, since they acted deliberately.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Prophylaxis</span></h3>

<p>At the same time, when all these measures were
weighed in the balance&mdash;plain speaking to the men on
arrival, police surveillance, medical examination, etc.&mdash;it
was felt that more might be done. A number
of medical officers accordingly gave instruction to
their men in the means of effecting prophylaxis and
of preventing infection in the event of association
with these women. The medical officers acted entirely
on their own responsibility. They advised the
men to avoid the risk, but as they knew a certain
number would not take their advice in any circumstances&mdash;in
fact the men said as much&mdash;they showed
them how to avoid infection if they would take the
necessary trouble.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Result of Prophylaxis</span></h3>

<p>In the case of our own unit, the First Australian
General Hospital, trouble was taken to explain in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
detail the consequences of venereal diseases to the
men, and to those with whom they would be associated
in later life. They were asked to refrain
from taking the risk, but for those who would not
take the advice&mdash;and there was bound to be a percentage&mdash;the
necessary directions and material were
provided for preventing infection. The result was
challenged by a medical officer, and an immediate
examination of all the men made, when it was
found that in the whole of the unit only one man
was infected. In other words, the precautions taken
had practically stamped the disease out of the unit,
and shortly after arrival in Cairo.</p>

<p>Once the disease was acquired the treatment was
troublesome to a degree. The men knew they were
disgraced; they would probably be sent back to Australia;
and in some cases, those of the finer men, the
consequences were serious. Mostly, however, they
developed an attitude of sullenness and indifference, a
tendency to lack of discipline, and they rendered
the management of camps difficult. These troubles
to a large extent disappeared when a suitable
hospital was established.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Soldiers' Clubs</span></h3>

<p>But another and constructive side of the matter
appealed forcibly to those concerned. Why not
supply for the benefit of the men places of entertainment
with music, refreshments, and the like,
similar to and better than those which the prostitutes
supplied, but minus the prostitute. In other words,
why not give a healthy and reasonable alternative?
After consultation with His Excellency Sir Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
MacMahon, with the G.O.C.-in-Chief, General Sir
John Maxwell, and with the D.M.S. Egypt, General
Ford, the Australian Red Cross Society determined
to combine with the Y.M.C.A. and establish clubs
for the soldiers in central positions where these requirements
would be met. They accordingly established
a club at the quay in Alexandria, and a magnificent
open-air club in the Esbekieh Gardens, Cairo.
They were both immediately successful, and have
played a most important part in the further limitation
of the amount of venereal disease. It is difficult to give
statistical evidence, but there is no doubt that by these
various means a sensible difference has been produced
in the incidence of disease amongst the troops.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Duty of the Medical Officer</span></h3>

<p>We have never wavered from the conviction that
any one suffering from venereal disease should be
treated by a medical practitioner exactly like any
other sick person. In military service, however, an
added element makes its appearance in that the
soldier by his act has rendered himself unfit, and
consequently must suffer some pains and penalties.
It is no answer to say that other men have exposed
themselves and have not become infected. The fact
remains that he has by a deliberate and avoidable
act deprived his country of the value of his services.
And whilst the doctrine of punishment should not be
pushed too far, he certainly should not receive the
same general treatment as other soldiers, and the
policy of his prompt return to Australia and deprivation
of pay was in the circumstances the best one.</p>

<p>In the Venereal Diseases Hospital, Abbassia, the
men were well treated. They were well fed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
a certain amount of Red Cross help was given to
them.</p>

<p>Many proposals were made which were not carried
into effect: for example, placing of the prostitute
quarter "out of bounds" and the posting of
sentries. It was realised that the immediate effect
of this action would have been to drive women to
the vicinity of the camps, and that it was impracticable.
Another practicable proposal was made, which,
however, was not carried into effect&mdash;the creation of
dispensaries in the vicinity of the prostitute quarter,
so that immediate treatment could be obtained. In
many camps such dispensaries were established by
the medical officers.</p>

<p>The essence of the problem was learnt by a
Brigadier-General who visited a number of young
educated men in one of the camps, and asked them
for their viewpoint on the subject. Their answer
was that which every medical officer knows full
well: that many men were influenced by the appeals
which had been made to them, but that a percentage
have indulged in this way throughout their adult
life, and intend to continue to do so irrespective of
anything medical officers, chaplains, or generals may
say to them. It is this fundamental position which
every reformer must face. So long as a sufficient
number of men determine to adopt this policy, and
so long as there is a sufficient number of women
prepared to cater for them, the problem of venereal
disease will continue to be acute in every country.</p>

<p>The opinion has been expressed elsewhere that
the world will not be rendered more or less moral
by the abolition of venereal disease, and instruction
in the mode of preventing infection should be an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
essential part of education. Because people are
immoral there is no reason why they should acquire
gonorrh&oelig;a or syphilis. If the <i>lex talionis</i> is to be
enforced, the logical way to deal with the matter
is to refuse treatment to all the infected, and
to let them die or become disabled. But the most
thorough-going Puritan shrinks from adopting so
terrible a policy. One method or the other, however,
must be adopted&mdash;there can be no half-way house.
And if the decision be in favour of eradicating the
disease, it is essential to firmly face and grapple
with the problem.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wassermann Tests</span></h3>

<p>The examination of the cases showed that gonorrh&oelig;a
was far more common than syphilis, and a
series of Wassermann determinations showed that
the cases of soft sores did not give a syphilitic
reaction in the early stages. Captain Watson of
the First General Hospital made a number of
determinations in order to try to settle this
important point.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Policy to be Adopted</span></h3>

<p>In spite of all that was done, 1,344 men were
returned to Australia disabled, and 450 were sent
to Malta. If a calculation be made of the cost of
sending these men to Egypt and back, and of
their pay before they were infected, some idea may
be formed of the enormous sum of money the
Australian Commonwealth wasted on men who were
a drag and hindrance to the army machine.</p>

<p>The Government should, on the raising and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
equipping of a volunteer army, treat it as older
countries treat a standing army by issuing instructions
to the men.</p>

<p>When the Hospitals left Australia neither officers
nor men received instructions, and not until the arrival
of Surgeon-General Williams in Egypt was any
serious collective action taken. He at once called
a conference of medical officers and did what he
could to limit the extent of disease.</p>

<p>The governmental action&mdash;or lack of action&mdash;is
unsound, since the man who contracts disease is
severely punished, but adequate attempts are not made
to prevent him acquiring it. The notable departure
made in the case of Cairo was the effort to make the
men understand clearly what these diseases meant to
them as soldiers and as citizens; to remove temptation
from them as far as possible, and with the aid of
the Australian Red Cross to give them a reasonable,
healthy, and decent alternative. Nothing the Australian
Red Cross has done (or is likely to do) is more
important than the establishment of the Soldiers'
Clubs. Nothing has been more successful or is
likely so to redound to the credit of that great
institution. And yet, under the new Constitution
of the Australian Red Cross, not a shilling can be
devoted in the future to such purposes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Venereal Diseases Conference</span></h3>

<p>The following are brief notes of a Conference of
senior medical officers convened by Surgeon-General
Williams.</p>

<p>Reference was made to the gravity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
problem with which the force was faced. It was
estimated that about 1,000 men of the First and
Second Australian Divisions are suffering from
venereal disease on any one day, and of these a
large number are incapacitated from work. The
proportions seemed to be much greater than those of
other forces, such as the Territorials, in Egypt. The
displacement of so large a proportion of men and the
ultimate consequence of numerous infections, rendered
it necessary to take a comprehensive view of
the position, and to endeavour to take some action to
minimise the damage done. It was proposed to ask
each officer present to furnish the secretary with a
general statement of the number of cases treated
under their command, specifying them under three
headings&mdash;syphilis, soft chancre, and gonorrh&oelig;a.
The information so obtained would form the basis
of a report to headquarters. The problem was
considered under five headings:</p>

<p>1. Military assistance.</p>

<p>2. Use of prophylaxis.</p>

<p>3. Treatment&mdash;general and special.</p>

<p>4. Establishment of convalescent depots&mdash;accommodation
and position.</p>

<p>5. Ultimate destination of affected men.</p>

<p>1. <i>In what way can the military authorities give
assistance?</i>&mdash;There are three ways in which they can
approach the problem:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) They may decide that all areas known to
contain brothels are out of bounds.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) They can provide adequate military control
by military police organised under a competent
officer, with one or more junior medical
officers to assist him.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>c</i>) That punishment can be inflicted on those
men who break bounds and expose themselves
to the risk of venereal infection. It might be
desirable to reduce the pay of men found in
those areas whether suffering from venereal
disease or not.</p></blockquote>

<p>2. <i>Prophylaxis.</i>&mdash;Officers were invited to discuss
the question whether it would not be advisable
to establish prophylactic depots in various parts
of Cairo. Men to report immediately after exposing
themselves to infection, and by cleanliness
and the use of medicaments prevent infection.
Circulars couched in plain and sensible language
might be issued to the troops, conveying to them a
knowledge of the risk they run, and the fact that if
infected they will take back to Australia a disease
which would reduce their value as citizens.</p>

<p>3. <i>General and Special Treatment.</i>&mdash;Suggestions
from officers present were invited.</p>

<p>4. <i>Convalescent Depots.</i>&mdash;Was it right that the
hospital should be crowded out with venereal cases,
which demanded very much time and attention from
the staffs? If the hospital was placed near the scene
of military action the wounded might suffer from
the amount of attention required for venereal cases.
Most venereal cases required rest in the main, and
this could be obtained in convalescent depots.</p>

<p>5. <i>The ultimate destination of the affected men.</i>&mdash;Two
courses are open: The men may be treated
in Egypt, or sent back to Australia.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) If they are kept in Egypt and the Australian
Expeditionary Force is moved to the
front its medical services would be depleted,
and medical men of great ability and experience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>would be left behind to take charge of
venereal cases when their services were required
at the front.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) If on the other hand the Australian and
Imperial Government could utilise some ships
for the accommodation of these men, those who
were cured could be sent to the front, and those
who could not be cured could be sent back to
Australia at once. But such ships would require
special staffing so that the existing units should
not be depleted in order to provide staffs.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the discussion which ensued it was represented
that there was a difficulty in placing areas out of
bounds, as the brothels would be moved to other
areas. Prophylaxis was regarded as most important.
Isolation tents could be set apart in the regimental
lines where men could be treated on return from
leave. Cases of syphilis should be sent to Australia.</p>

<p>The reduction of pay is forbidden by King's
Regulations, and although the Minister for Defence
in the Commonwealth of Australia authorised such
reduction, it is only for such period as the troops
are in Egypt.</p>

<p>It was agreed that cases of syphilis should be
returned to Australia, as there is no chance in
Egypt of treating them efficiently, and even if such
treatment were available the men would not be fit
for duty for from four to six months.</p>

<p>It was pointed out that at least 100 men left
Australia with the First Division suffering from
venereal disease.</p>

<p>The chief difficulty seemed to be what venereal
cases would ultimately be of service to a fighting
line, and to properly arrange for them during convalescence;
in other words, when and how men
considered unfit for further service should be returned
to Australia. Officers were asked to recollect that
the future of these soldiers was to be considered
and the part they would play in civil life. In the
American Navy unbounded shore leave had been
given, and had some effect in checking the disease.
In the British Navy it was an offence not to report
"exposure."</p>

<p>The Soldiers' Clubs are fully described in the
chapter on the Red Cross. They were rendered
possible by an alliance between the Y.M.C.A. and
the Australian Branch British Red Cross. To the
Y.M.C.A., who managed them, the best thanks of
Australia should be given, for Australians will never
fully know what they owe to Mr. Jessop and his
assistants. Unfortunately, the Australian Branch
British Red Cross subsequently decided that help
should be given <i>only</i> to sick and wounded. Although
convalescents frequent these clubs, the view was
taken&mdash;we think wrongly&mdash;that Red Cross funds
could not be used for their support. We feel sure
that when Australians fully understand the matter
the decision will be reversed.</p>

<p class="center"><big><b>CHAPTER IX</b></big></p>


<p>The British Red Cross Society, Australian Branch,
was founded by Her Excellency Lady Helen
Munro Ferguson, wife of the Governor-General of
Australia, on the outbreak of war. On previous
occasions unsuccessful attempts had been made to
found an Australian Red Cross Society. On this
occasion the movement was most successful, although
many people then (like some people now)
were quite unable to understand the distinction
between the Red Cross movement and military
administration.</p>

<p>The Red Cross Society in Australia undertook
the collection of funds for immediate
transmission to the British Red Cross Society for
prompt use in the field. Branches were formed in
each State and committees were formed by the
wives of the various governors. Thus a rough-and-ready
arrangement was made prior to the
adoption of a constitution. It was considered far
more important to do the work than to waste
time holding meetings and devising a constitution.
Those who could not afford to give money were
invited to make clothing or to contribute articles
of various kinds. Specifications of the clothing
requisite were given, and patterns furnished so
that it might be readily made on approved
design. It is not too much to say that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
majority of the inhabitants of the Continent were
soon engaged in some way or other in helping
the Red Cross movement. The ball-rooms of
the respective Government Houses were used as
depots. The depot at Federal Government House,
Melbourne, was an excellent model. People were
invited to send their donations irrespective of
their number or their kind. These were received
and receipted, and were then sorted into
bundles of similar articles by lady volunteers.
They were then placed in cases by volunteer
packers, mostly experienced men from various
warehouses, and were finally dispatched to Europe
as opportunity offered.</p>

<p>The arrangement of these details fell largely on
the Council and Secretary of the Branch (one of
us, J. W. B.) in Australia acting under the direction
of the President, Her Excellency Lady Helen Munro
Ferguson. Very great difficulty was experienced in
finding space in merchant ships for the conveyance
of the goods. Space was found on the transports,
but there was not the same security for delivery.
In addition the hospitals of the transports were
provided with such equipment as the officers
commanding desired.</p>

<p>When, however, the Lines of Communication
Units were ordered to Egypt, another problem
arose, and the Australian Red Cross Society decided
to properly equip these units both with money
and goods. For this purpose £10,000 was set aside
and forwarded to London. It was handed to the
British Red Cross Society and kept available for the
officers commanding the five hospitals, the requisite
sum of money to be allotted to them by Surgeon-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Williams, C.B., the Director of Medical
Services in Australia, who had proceeded to Europe.
At the time it was supposed that these five hospitals
were proceeding to France. In addition large quantities
of goods were available at the British Red Cross
Society in London, and large quantities of goods
were given to the several hospitals for dispatch with
their equipment. When, however, the hospitals
were sent to Egypt a new situation arose. There
were many other medical units in Egypt besides the
hospitals. There were the Field Ambulances and
the Regimental Medical Officers, and Surgeon-General
Williams regarded them as equally worthy of
assistance. On his arrival in Egypt at first, in
December, and subsequently in the middle of February,
the scope of the British Red Cross, Australian
Branch, in relation to Australian troops had extended
far beyond the original intention. The action taken
is described in the following report sent to the
President and members of the Council, British Red
Cross Society, Australian Branch, on my resignation
(Lieut.-Col. Barrett) from that body on
September 9, 1915. I did not at any time receive
any instructions from Australia, and acted in the
manner which seemed best after consultation with
local authorities.</p>

<div class="center">REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE AUSTRALIAN
BRANCH BRITISH RED CROSS IN
EGYPT, FROM MARCH TO SEPTEMBER 3,
1915<br /><br />
<i>By</i> <span class="smcap">James W. Barrett</span>, <i>Lieut.-Colonel, Lately
Executive Officer, Australian Branch British Red
Cross Society</i>
</div>

<div class="center">
<span class="smcap">Report presented to the President and
Members of the Council of the Australian
Branch British Red Cross Society</span>
</div>

<p>The First Australian General Hospital arrived in
Egypt in January 1915. I was associated with it as
Registrar and Oculist and had nothing to do with the
Red Cross movement beyond assuming responsibility
for any Red Cross goods which belonged to the
Hospital.</p>

<p>When leaving Melbourne Colonel Ramsay Smith
was informed that there would be room for 100 tons
of Red Cross goods in the <i>Kyarra</i>. When, however,
the <i>Kyarra</i> reached Melbourne her holds were
full and no Red Cross goods were taken on board.
There were consequently not any Red Cross goods
available at No. 1 Australian General Hospital for
some considerable time after arrival in Egypt.</p>

<p>Surgeon-General Williams, C.B., arrived in Egypt
in the middle of February, and at once proceeded to
organise the Red Cross movement. He had been entrusted
with £10,000 which was to be expended by the
officers commanding medical units according to the
plan set out later. He at once took action, and money
was distributed to a number of hospitals and medical
units. This distribution was of the utmost service.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a href="images/i183.jpg"><img src="images/i183-t.jpg" width="400" height="255" alt="" /></a><br />

<i>To face page 141</i></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>When Red Cross goods began to arrive in Egypt he
sought a suitable store. Finding nothing in Cairo
at a reasonable price, he established a store in the
basement of the Heliopolis Palace Hotel, No. 1
Australian General Hospital, for which, of course,
no rental was charged. The store was placed under
the immediate charge of the Orderly Medical Officer,
Captain Max Yuille, and under my general direction.
The distribution of money and collection of goods
from ships was effected by General Williams through
his own office in Cairo.</p>

<p>General Williams left for London on duty on
April 25, leaving me in charge of the Red Cross work,
and leaving his Warrant Officer, Mr. Drummond, in
his office to continue the collection of goods and the
clerical work.</p>

<p>Soon after he had left, the crisis of May and June
took place. Wounded and sick were poured into
Cairo on a scale probably never known or equalled
before. There have been occasions on which a
much larger number of men have been wounded,
but probably never any occasion in history in which
so many wounded men have been handled in so
limited a space. Fortunately preparation had been
made by the D.M.S. Egypt, Surgeon-General Ford,
D.S.O., and the D.M.S. A.I.F., Surgeon-General
Williams, C.B., who instructed the O.C. First Australian
General Hospital, Colonel Ramsay Smith, and
myself as registrar to take over extra buildings and
provide equipment. It was this action which prevented
a disaster, and whilst not strictly a Red Cross
matter was greatly aided by Red Cross equipment.</p>

<p>During this crisis I was instructed by the D.M.S.
Egypt, Surgeon-General Ford, and the O.C. Australian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Intermediate Base, Colonel Sellheim, to visit various
hospitals in Egypt&mdash;both in Alexandria and the
provinces&mdash;to interview the Australian wounded and
supply all reasonable comforts. In accordance with
this order, money and goods, either or both, were sent
to various hospitals as set out in the various tables.</p>

<p>It so happened that the British Red Cross Society
possessed neither money nor goods at the inception
of the crisis, and the authorities were profoundly
grateful for the help which the Australian Branch
afforded. The British Red Cross, Egyptian Branch,
at a later stage received large supplies of money and
goods which were freely distributed. The fact that
goods could be obtained from the British Red Cross
Society, Australian Branch, soon became known,
and many requisitions were received. The list of
goods available was widely circulated and in no
instance was the requisition of any Officer Commanding
not complied with. It was always completed to
the extent of our resources. Periodical reports of
the work done were prepared and forwarded to the
President of the Australian Branch British Red
Cross Society, Melbourne.</p>

<p>Whilst the work was at its height a message from
Australia reached His Excellency Sir Henry MacMahon,
in consequence of which two Committees
were formed on June 3, 1915&mdash;a General Egyptian
Committee and an Executive Committee.</p>

<p>The members were:</p>

<div class="left">

</table>
</div>

<p>Sir Courtauld Thomson is the Commissioner in
the Mediterranean for the British Red Cross Society,
and Sir John Rogers and Dr. Ruffer Deputy Commissioners
in Egypt.</p>

<p>Surgeon-General Williams and Lieut.-Col. Barrett
were appointed members of the Executive Committee
of the British Red Cross Society in Egypt.</p>

<p>There was no amalgamation of the two branches,
but by this arrangement each was kept informed
of the activity of the other and wasteful overlapping
was avoided.</p>

<p>Members of the General Committee investigated the
work of the Australian Branch, were consulted in
matters of policy, and received and investigated any
complaints. They were most helpful.</p>

<p>General Williams returned to Egypt on June 21,
made a tour of inspection, and visited the Australian
wounded. He reported to the Government, and
finally left for London on duty on June 29. On this
occasion he took with him his office staff, and consequently
the administration fell largely into my hands.</p>

<p>On July 13, however, I learned by cable from
Australia that two Commissioners had been appointed
in terms which seemed to place them in
entire control of the Red Cross movement.</p>

<p>As it was desirable that other medical officers
should be associated with the movement. Colonel
Ryan, Colonel Martin, and Lieut.-Col. Springthorpe
were invited by His Excellency Sir Henry MacMahon
to join the Executive Committee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Adrian Knox, K. C., the first of the Commissioners,
arrived in Cairo on August 11, and
the second Commissioner, Mr. Brookes, reported on
August 27. I endeavoured to help them in every way
that was possible, and finally asked to be relieved of
the work on September 9, expressing my willingness,
however, to continue to aid in any way they desired.
My relationship to them has been cordial, and I am
very glad if I have been able to be of any assistance.</p>

<p>I now propose to deal with the operations of the
Society under various headings:</p>

<p>1. <i>Finance.</i>&mdash;The original fund in the hands of
Surgeon-General Williams was operated upon by
him in London, in Malta, and in Egypt. It was
only in Egypt that I was concerned with it, and
to a limited extent. It was most helpful, and
great service was rendered during the crisis by
the prompt distribution of money.</p>

<p>When the General Committee, of which His Excellency
Sir Henry MacMahon is President, was
formed, separate funds were forwarded to him in
response to a cable from me indicating that more
money was wanted. I suggested the supply of
another £10,000, but when, on July 9, £18,000 had
been received it became obvious that operations
were contemplated on a more extensive scale than
had hitherto been thought necessary. I have prepared
a summary of the amounts distributed to
medical units from both funds, and given an
account of the method adopted.</p>

<p>The Red Cross Society originally intended that
£10,000 was to be expended by the officers commanding
medical units, and General Williams embodied
the direction in the following circular, to which
I subsequently added a memorandum in further
explanation of new conditions which had arisen.</p>

<p>The Egyptian pound is to the British pound
sterling as 100:97·5.</p>

<p>In addition, a considerable amount of money had
been spent in other countries. There was, however,
no knowledge in Egypt of the sum which
would be ultimately available. Furthermore, in
the absence of instructions from Australia, no
serious departure had been made from the policy
originally laid down. In fact I am doubtful to a
degree whether any Red Cross movement should in
normal conditions go beyond the successful policy
adopted.</p>

<p>2. <i>Red Cross Store.</i>&mdash;Goods received were passed
into the Red Cross store, the contents of the cases
ascertained as far as possible, and entered in books
kept for that purpose. They were issued on requisition
signed by the Officer Commanding any medical
unit. Corresponding entry was made in the book
of issue, and the difference between the stock received
and that issued from day to day was shown in the
form of a stock sheet. Stock-taking was effected
from time to time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>The store was staffed at first by two nurses and
three orderlies, later it was staffed by a sergeant and
six or seven orderlies who were approved by the
military authorities. The staff therefore consisted
of myself, with my own clerical staff, the orderly
officer of the hospital, Captain Max Yuille (latterly
Captain Dunn), the sergeant and seven orderlies,
together with extra helpers at times. The store
was connected by telephone with the hospital,
and every effort made, compatible with the excessive
demands on the time of all, to manage it in a
methodical manner.</p>

<p>3. <i>Receipt of Goods.</i>&mdash;The receipt of goods has,
owing to the peculiarities of Egypt and the circumstances
of the war, given a good deal of trouble, and
I am making it the subject of a separate memorandum.
It may suffice here to say that it will never
be satisfactory until the Red Cross Society in
Australia cables, when the ship leaves Fremantle,
precisely the number of packages on board, the port
of destination, and the probable time of arrival of
the ship; and also accurately informs the officers
commanding the ship of the nature of the Red Cross goods
on board. In this connection it may be interesting
to note the following letter from Colonel Onslow,
who has just arrived by the <i>Runic</i> in Egypt, and
who, but for the printed instructions drawn up by
me and conveyed to him at Suez, would not have
known that any Red Cross goods were on board:</p>

asked me to write to you regarding the Red Cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Stores on the Transport A 54 <i>Runic</i> of which I was in
military command.</p>

<p>When I took command on August 9 in Sydney
I had no information as to there being any Red
Cross Stores on board except that one of the ladies
of the Red Cross Committee had told me that a few
stores were to be put on board and would be at my
disposal if needed for the troops under my command.</p>

<p>Subsequently I saw some half a dozen cases which
I assumed to be those to which she had alluded.</p>

<p>On arrival at Suez, September 9, the printed instructions
as to disposal of Red Cross Stores were
handed to me. This caused me to make inquiries.
The ship's purser knew nothing of any such stores
and they were not shown in the manifest.</p>

<p>But from the Chief Officer I learned that a large
number of which he had an incomplete list had been
placed in one of the holds. It was even then too late
for me to ascertain their number or nature, as I was
in the midst of disembarking returning ship stores,
etc. They were therefore landed without the required
list.</p>

<p>But if either a wireless had been sent to me a day
or two beforehand, or if the persons responsible for
shipping had informed me in Sydney, there would
have been no difficulty whatever. Under the lack
of system which would seem to prevail in shipping
these stores from Australia it would not be surprising
if they were overcarried and lost.</p>

Yours faithfully,<br />

</blockquote>

<p>I publish this letter simply to show the difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and to indicate the magnitude of the task. I do not
think any one is to blame, but rectification is wanted.
A huge commercial concern has gradually grown up
and now requires firm paid commercial management.
The Australian Red Cross has become a gigantic
Commercial Institution with attendant advantages
and disadvantages.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that goods are shipped
in Australia from at least six different ports separated
by distances of hundreds of miles, that nearly the
whole of the work has been amateur, and that it
is difficult to inaugurate a proper business system
rapidly.</p>

<p>The following are the printed directions referred
to by Colonel Onslow:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="right"><span class="smcap">Headquarters, Cairo.</span><br /></div>
<p>
<i>From</i> A.D.M.S., Australian Force,<br />
Headquarters, Cairo.<br />
<br />
<i>To</i> O.C. Troopship&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>1. Will you please instruct a Medical Officer to
make a list in duplicate of the surplus medical
stores and Red Cross goods, including ambulances,
on the ship. He will hand one list to the representative
of Australian Intermediate Base (Captain
Clayton) and retain the other.</p>

<p>2. Will you please detail a Medical Officer, or if
that be impossible another Commissioned Officer, who
will see that these goods are put on the train, and
travel with them to their point of destination.</p>

<p>3. At the place of destination he will hand them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
over with an inventory to a representative of
A.D.M.S. Australian Force (Lieut.-Colonel Barrett),
from whom he will obtain a receipt. He will not,
under any circumstances, hand them over to any one
else, or take any verbal receipt.</p>

<p>4. If it be impossible to send the goods by passenger
train they may proceed by goods train, in
which case an N.C.O. or orderly must be detailed
to travel in the brake van; and deliver the
goods to a representative of A.D.M.S. Australian
Force (Lieut.-Colonel Barrett) in precisely the same
way.</p>

<p>5. You will please detail a fatigue party of sufficient
strength for unloading the goods from the
transport and placing them on the train, and in
addition supply any guard that is necessary to
protect them until this work is completed.</p>

<p>6. It is undesirable in any circumstances to send
goods by troop train. It is much better to send
them by goods train.</p>

<p>7. Will you please convey these orders in writing
to the Medical Officer or Officer concerned. If any
conflicting orders be issued he can then produce
this authority.</p>

<div class="right">

</blockquote>

<p>4. <i>Distribution of Goods.</i>&mdash;The distribution of
goods was effected on requisition signed by the O.C.
of the medical unit requiring them, transport was
provided by the Red Cross Society to the railway
station (usually by motor lorries) and at public
expense on the railways. I soon learnt that in
Egypt in time of war there is no certainty of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
delivery of the goods to the proper quarter unless
some one is sent with them. The railway officials
will frequently hand over goods to a military officer
without obtaining a receipt. Accordingly one or
more orderlies were sent with every train conveying
Red Cross goods. They handed the goods to the
consignee and brought back the receipt.</p>

<p>In the Australian hospitals the distribution of goods
was effected by two methods. Anything wanted
from the central store could be obtained by requisition
signed by the O.C. of the hospital, and
countersigned by myself as Red Cross officer. Very
large quantities of goods were thus transferred
from the central store to the quartermaster's department.
They were then issued in the ordinary
way by requisition of the sisters or medical officers,
and those receiving them were not aware whether
they were receiving Red Cross goods or Ordnance
goods. The system had the merit of extreme simplicity,
and was very speedy in its operation. It
certainly seemed at the time far less important
that patients should know where the goods came
from than that they should obtain them promptly.
Later on the expediency of putting a Red Cross
label on everything supplied became obvious and
was adopted as a policy.</p>

<p>5. <i>Scope of Operations.</i>&mdash;At first the operations of
the Society were confined to Egypt, but soon, in
conjunction with the British Red Cross, goods
were forwarded to the Dardanelles and elsewhere.
The tables show the quantity of goods sent to
transports in the Mediterranean and transports
leaving for Australia. No request was ever refused.
When dispatching goods to the Dardanelles it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
considered better to act, as far as possible, through
the British Red Cross Society.</p>

<p>On July 5 I wrote to General Birdwood, Commanding
Officer A. and N.Z. Army Corps, asking
him whether I could establish a Red Cross store
at Anzac. He replied that it was impossible, but
at his suggestion a Red Cross store at Mudros in
the island of Lemnos was organised in conjunction
with the British Red Cross Society. The Army
Medical Corps at Anzac was then advised to
requisition on Mudros. The difficulties, however,
of landing goods at Mudros were very great&mdash;so
great that the British Red Cross Society was
compelled to buy launches and lighters. The
Australian Red Cross Commissioners are about to
supplement the purchase. The tables show the
quantity and character of the goods sent forward in
spite of many difficulties. It was often necessary
to send an orderly in the hospital ship to Mudros
and Anzac to ensure delivery.</p>

<p>6. <i>Other Activities.</i>&mdash;The British Red Cross Australian
Branch arranged through the Y.M.C.A. for the
free distribution of stationery to the soldiers in hospitals
in Egypt. With the assistance of the Y.M.C.A.
and some English ladies in Cairo a number of committees
were formed to entertain the sick and
wounded in various ways. A cinema was purchased,
a small orchestra was engaged to visit the hospitals,
bands of ladies agreed to take flowers and the like
to the hospitals, and everything was done that
could be done to render the tedium of convalescence
less objectionable.</p>

<p>Large recreation huts were built at many of the
hospitals at the expense of the Australian Branch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>This phase of the work should not be passed over
without the most handsome acknowledgment to
the English ladies in Cairo. These public-spirited
ladies, headed by Mrs. Elgood, thoroughly organised
what I may call the lighter side of hospital
work, and not only by their personal attention,
but also by their tactful skill, succeeded in making
the conditions of the sick and wounded much more
comfortable. Furthermore although we left Australia
knowing that the Y.M.C.A. did good work in camps,
yet the practical experience of the Y.M.C.A. work
in Egypt has left an indelible impression on our
minds. Headed by Mr. Jessop, their secretary,
there was no service in connection with the sick
and wounded which they failed to render when
provided with the proper means. We felt the
utmost confidence in entrusting them with any
undertaking, provided that the position was clearly
defined and provided that they were not hampered
in their activities.</p>

<p>In passing it may be said that until June 15 the
shortage of nurses and medical officers was considerable.
Of lay helpers there were few in Cairo
during the summer, and the principle was invariably
adopted of using all existing agencies to cover
the ground, the necessary support being given by
the Red Cross Society. It was on this principle
that Mrs. Elgood acted, it was on this principle that
the Y.M.C.A. acted, and it is on this principle that
all great organisations can be most successfully conducted.
If it had become necessary to create an independent
organisation to provide cinemas and bands,
to disburse stationery in Egypt and at the Dardanelles,
distribute flowers, fruit, games, etc., a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
large number of soldiers would have been employed
who were much better employed otherwise. Furthermore,
they would not have done the work as well
as Mrs. Elgood's staff or the Y.M.C.A.</p>

<p>7. <i>Issue of Purchased Goods.</i>&mdash;As the fund grew
in volume it was decided to spend some of it in the
purchase of articles desired by the men. A vote
was taken at No. 1 Auxiliary Convalescent Depot
(Luna Park) to ascertain the articles the men most
desired&mdash;see appendix. Boxes containing a number
of articles were issued to every patient on admission.
This has involved an expenditure rising to £500 per
month. A sample box has already been sent to
Australia. In each box the following note was
placed:</p>

<p>"The object of the Australian Red Cross Society
is to provide comfort and help to the wounded and
sick soldiers, such as hospital clothing, invalid comforts,
tobacco, toilet necessaries, books, magazines,
newspapers, and the like, and also recreation huts for
entertainment, etc.</p>

<p>"These comforts are supplied over and above the
hospital necessaries which the Commonwealth of
Australia furnishes on so liberal a scale.</p>

<p>"The Society hopes that your stay in the hospital
will be short and pleasant, and that your convalescence
will be rapid so that you can speedily serve your
country again. The Society asks you to accept the
contents of this box as an indication of Australia's
desire to help you."</p>

<p>8. <i>Convalescent Home at Montazah.</i>&mdash;The Montazah
palace, which was owned by the late Khedive,
was offered to Lady Graham by H.H. the Sultan
as a Convalescent Home for soldiers. The British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Red Cross Society and the Australian Branch combined
and agreed to find £3,500 to equip it. This
beautiful hospital consists of a number of buildings
situated on the shore of the Mediterranean, with
artificial harbours and provision for bathing, fishing,
and boating. It is now in excellent order and is
most successful.</p>

<p>While I think it was right to take a share in
the erection of this convalescent home, which indeed
could not have been obtained as a military
hospital, it immediately raised in mind the consideration
of the propriety of the Red Cross conducting
hospitals in any circumstances. It is of course the
English practice, and the special circumstances of
Great Britain may make it necessary to erect Red
Cross hospitals. The Commonwealth of Australia
has never prevented the establishment of as many
hospitals as may be considered necessary in the field.
In my judgment it is better to limit the conduct
of military hospitals and convalescent hospitals to
official authority, leaving the Red Cross to supplement
the work in the way already indicated. Otherwise
the Red Cross is simply doing Governmental
work. The Red Cross may do the work very well
indeed, but the advantage is not obvious.</p>

<p>9. <i>Motor Transport.</i>&mdash;The motor ambulances presented
by the Australian Branch have been housed
in two garages, one at Heliopolis and the other at
Gezira. They were both designed by Surgeon-General
Williams and provided from Red Cross Funds. It
is not too much to say that the organisation of the
motor transport assisted materially in saving the
position. For a long time, with the exception of
some New Zealand ambulances, there were no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
ambulances in Egypt. At Heliopolis a repairing
plant was installed at Red Cross expense in order
to reduce the cost of repairs.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the British Red Cross
Australian Branch was at the outset of exceptional
service because it possessed on the spot stores,
money, and motor transport.</p>

<p>10. <i>Bureau of Inquiry.</i>&mdash;The British Red Cross
Society instituted a bureau of inquiry in order to
obtain supplemental information about the sick and
wounded. Inquiries on an elaborate scale are made
at the office of the Commonwealth Government, but
certain supplementary and private inquiries can be
made with profit. The British Red Cross Society
was requested to undertake such inquiries and to
charge Australian Red Cross for the extra assistance
necessitated.</p>

<p>11. <i>Hospital Trains.</i>&mdash;At an early stage steps
were taken to equip hospital trains running from
Alexandria to Cairo with everything the officers in
charge required.</p>

<p>Furthermore, arrangements were made at Red
Cross expense to provide a restaurant car on all
trains conveying sick and wounded to Suez. For
detailed arrangements see page <a href="#Page_166">166</a>. This arrangement
has proved of great benefit. The men obtained
free lime juice and water and their rations. They
could purchase in addition comforts at bed-rock
prices. The innovation may seem a small one, but it
was not effected without considerable trouble owing
to shortage of rolling stock.</p>

<p>12. <i>Soldiers' Clubs.</i>&mdash;Reference has been made in
the chapter on Venereal Diseases to the damage
done to Australian troops in Egypt by venereal
disease. Reference has also been made to the establishment
of soldiers' clubs and recreation huts in
various places to provide a counter-attraction to those
entertainments furnished by the prostitute and her degraded
male attendants. After the various repressive
steps already referred to had been taken, an earnest
attempt was made to organise this constructive
work. The valuable assistance of Mr. Jessop and
the Y.M.C.A. was again invited. The Y.M.C.A.
proposed to build in Alexandria on the sea front a
large building to be used as a central soldiers' club,
and to be available for convalescents and the healthy.
The Y.M.C.A. had only £250 available and required
£1,000. The British Red Cross Society was
appealed to and hesitated. A cable was dispatched
to London, and an expenditure of £250 authorised.
Surgeon-General Williams, after consultation with
His Excellency Sir Henry MacMahon, the G.O.C.-in-Chief,
Sir John Maxwell, and the D.M.S. Egypt,
General Ford, decided to make a grant of £500 in
addition for the purpose. The club was opened on
September 12, and from its opening was a pronounced
success. The soldier on leave, tramping about the
streets of Alexandria, gets leg-weary and falls an easy
victim to the wiles of the various agents abroad. He
now can visit his own club, where the entry is free to
all men in uniform. He there receives war telegrams,
stationery, cheap and excellent meals, and enjoys
various forms of entertainment. He meets his friends,
and can spend the time under the most pleasant conditions.
The building already requires extension,
as the pressure on the accommodation is so great.
Similar action was taken in Cairo, where after many
unsuccessful attempts the Rink Theatre in the beautiful
Esbekieh gardens was obtained, owing to the
sympathetic help given by His Excellency Sir Henry
MacMahon and other authorities. This open-air
theatre is a little over an acre in extent, and is a
valuable property. It had been leased to a restaurant
keeper in the vicinity. Arrangements were made for
the supply of light refreshments at bed-rock prices
in the theatre, and other meals at low prices at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
restaurant which is about fifty yards away. In
addition a soldiers' club, managed by ladies, is equidistant,
and at this comfortable resort refreshments
are supplied in quiet rooms at low rates. Naturally the
club has become a resort for all the soldiers in Cairo.
Major Harvey, Commissioner of Police, has cleared
the surrounding gardens of undesirable characters.
The club was placed under the management of a joint
committee of which Her Excellency Lady MacMahon
is Patroness, and Lady Maxwell is President. The
executive committee consists of three members of
the Y.M.C.A., and the expenses of managing the
club were provided by the British Red Cross Society,
Australian Branch, for the first three months. It
was soon found that in order to make the club successful
the athletic element must be developed, and
splendid programmes were arranged&mdash;boxing, fencing,
skating contests, and the like. The club provides
writing-paper, games, war telegrams, Australian and
other newspapers, shower baths, and other conveniences.
As many as 1,500 soldiers are present on
some of these occasions, and the club is visited by
officers who periodically drop in amongst the men.
Altogether the success has exceeded even the sanguine
expectations of those who founded it.</p>

<p>The British Red Cross Society, Australian Branch,
was most fortunate in securing such a site, as any
one acquainted with the conditions of Cairo is fully
aware.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a href="images/i215.jpg"><img src="images/i215-t.jpg" width="400" height="252" alt="" /></a><br />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Matrons and Nurses, No. 1 Australian General Hospital.</span><br />
<i>To face page 169</i></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>The exact extent to which these clubs have contributed
to the limitation of venereal disease cannot be
accurately measured, but there is no doubt whatever
in the minds of any one acquainted with the
facts respecting their salutary and healthy influence.
Under the new constitution of the Australian Red
Cross money cannot be devoted to their maintenance,
because it is not being used exclusively for the sick
and wounded. Such is the ruling, although many
convalescents use the clubs. It is regrettable that
such a rigid ruling should have been established.
It is absurd to permit men to become infected and
then to assist them by doles of chocolate and tobacco,
and yet to refuse to provide the necessary funds which
assist so materially in preventing infection.</p>

<p>13. <i>Nurses' Rest Homes.</i>&mdash;The nurses in the hospitals
had done excellent work under trying conditions, and
it became obvious that many of them would break
down unless holidays and rest were provided.</p>

<p>The British and Australian Red Cross Branches
combined under the Presidency of Her Excellency
Lady MacMahon, and opened two rest homes&mdash;one
in Ramleh near the beach, and the other at Aboukir
Bay, the site of Nelson's victory.</p>

<p>They were furnished by the Red Cross Societies
and have been maintained by the Commonwealth
Government so far as the Australian nurses are concerned.
They have met a great want and have
proved a boon and a blessing.</p>

<p><i>Conclusion.</i>&mdash;The work has been very heavy and
the circumstances far from easy. Taking everything
into consideration and realising the pressure at
both ends, the result can only be regarded as more
than satisfactory. The policy of the Red Cross
Society requires, however, some consideration.</p>

<p>The policy adopted until lately was that reasonable
intimation should be given to the Red Cross
Society of the requirements of those who want
help. Under public pressure another policy may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
make its appearance&mdash;that of compelling the Red
Cross Society to find out what people want. A
word of caution is necessary. This policy will
almost certainly result in the creation of an extensive
business organisation and in the Red Cross
undertaking much work which the Government
should do. In my opinion the Red Cross Society
is entirely ancillary, its functions being to provide
comforts and other things which the Government
cannot supply, and to act decisively at critical
moments. It should, however, refrain from embarking
on great national undertakings.</p>

<p>Every one will endeavour to help the Commissioners
in their extensive and difficult task, and
will look forward to the Australian Red Cross maintaining
the high reputation which it has already
gained amongst responsible officers in Egypt.</p>

<p>In conclusion it should be pointed out that during
the whole period under review all necessary services
were provided by the military authorities and the
Red Cross was administered on military principles.
Consequently there were no large expenses, no one
received any money in payment for services, and the
storage of goods was free.</p>

<p>If the Red Cross is to be administered on non-military
lines many charges must be properly made
and met, but the efficiency of the system instituted
and now set aside must be judged largely from the
standpoint of economic administration.</p>

<div class="center">3. <i>Fence or Ambulance?</i></div>

<p>Some critics have objected to the Red Cross
assisting Soldiers' Clubs. The following lines are
commended to their notice. But for the Australian
Branch British Red Cross there would have been
no such Soldiers' Clubs as those provided at
Esbekieh and Alexandria.</p>

<div class="poem">
'Twas a dangerous cliff, as they freely confessed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though to walk near its crest was so pleasant;</span><br />
But over its terrible edge there had slipped<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A duke, and full many a peasant.</span><br />
So the people said something would have to be done,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But their projects did not at all tally:</span><br />
Some said, "Put a fence round the edge of the cliff";<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some, "an ambulance down in the valley."</span><br />
<br />
But the cry for the ambulance carried the day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For it spread through the neighbouring city,</span><br />
A fence may be useful or not, it is true,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But each heart became brimful of pity</span><br />
<br />
For those who had slipped over that dangerous cliff;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the dwellers in highway and alley</span><br />
Gave pounds or gave pence, not to put up a fence,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But an ambulance down in the valley.</span><br />
<br />
"For the cliff is all right if you're careful," they said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And if folks even slip and are dropping,</span><br />
It isn't the slipping that hurts them so much<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the shock down below when they're stopping."</span><br />
So day after day, as those mishaps occurred,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quick forth would these rescuers sally</span><br />
To pick up the victims who fell off the cliff,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the ambulance down in the valley.</span><br />
<br />
Then an old sage remarked, "It's a marvel to me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That people give far more attention</span><br />
To repairing results than to stopping the cause<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When they'd much better aim at prevention.</span><br />
Let us stop at its source all this mischief," cried he,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Come, neighbours and friends, let us rally!</span><br />
If the cliff we will fence we might almost dispense<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the ambulance down in the valley."</span><br />
<br />
"Oh, he's a fanatic," the others rejoined.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Dispense with the ambulance? Never!</span><br />
He'd dispense with all charities, too, if he could!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No, no! We'll support them for ever!</span><br />
Aren't we picking folks up just as fast as they fall?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shall this man dictate to us? Shall he?</span><br />
Why should people of sense stop to put up a fence<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While their ambulance works in the valley?"</span><br />
But a sensible few, who are practical too,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will not bear with such nonsense much longer;</span><br />
They believe that prevention is better than cure,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And their party will soon be the stronger.</span><br />
Encourage them, then, with your purse, voice, and pen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And (while other philanthropists dally)</span><br />
They will scorn all pretence, and put a stout fence<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the cliff that hangs over the valley.</span><br />
<br />
Better guide well the young than reclaim them when old,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the voice of true wisdom is calling:</span><br />
"To rescue the fallen is good, but 'tis best<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To prevent other people from falling.</span><br />
Better close up the course of temptation and crime<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than deliver from dungeon or galley;</span><br />
Better put a strong fence round the top of the cliff,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than an ambulance down in the valley."</span><br />

<h3><span class="smcap">The Red Cross Policy: Wanted, a Definition</span></h3>

<p>Before leaving consideration of the details of the
Red Cross question, attention should be directed to
the numerous changes in the policy adopted by
the British Red Cross Society, Australian Branch.
No less than three different types of administration
were rapidly adopted. It was first placed in the
hands of Surgeon-General Williams and the High
Commissioner for Australia, in London; then it
was placed under a committee in Egypt formed
by the High Commissioner for Egypt, Sir Henry
MacMahon, and six weeks later two Commissioners
were appointed to take the work over. Nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
more clearly illustrates the state of mental instability
in which a first experience of war had thrown
the population of Australia. The policy which was
adopted by Surgeon-General Williams in connection
with the Red Cross administration is that which
we believe to be sound.</p>

<p>When acting as A.D.M.S. to the Australian Force
in Egypt it became my duty (Lieut.-Col. Barrett) to
sanction or modify the requisitions of medical stores
for the various hospitals and units, and the instructions
conveyed to me were that I could sanction any
requisition provided that it was reasonable. If,
however, it represented a new departure it must
be authorised by the D.M.S. Egypt. This meant
practically that everything could be obtained from
Ordnance, and many of the Red Cross supplies
became superfluous. That is to say, any necessary
goods in the Red Cross store were utilised, but if
they had not been there the Government would
have purchased them. In fact, it reduced the field
in which the Red Cross could operate to comparatively
small proportions. There is no doubt that,
had it become necessary, I should have authorised
the erection of shelter sheds and recreation huts in
the various hospitals as a medical necessity. There
was one advantage, and one advantage alone, in
effecting these changes with the aid of the Red Cross.
The action if sanctioned by superior officers could not
be challenged by any one else at the time, and could
be effected with extraordinary speed.</p>

<p>I took the view that it was the business of the
Officer Commanding the hospital, with the aid of the
matron, sisters, and medical officers, to let me know
what was thought necessary, and unless the requirement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
was outrageous it was immediately supplied.
As a matter of fact no single request for money or
goods was ever refused or seriously modified. Owing
to pressure of public criticism another policy began
to make its appearance. It was asserted that it
was the duty of the Red Cross officer to visit the
various hospitals to find out what the patients
ought to receive. It will be seen that such a policy
removed from the O.C.s of the hospitals, or any
one to whom they may have delegated their powers,
the responsibility for determining what patients
should receive. Such a policy sooner or later must
result in the creation of an army of people who
are worrying to find out what they can do instead
of being properly instructed by those responsible
for the welfare of the patients.</p>

<p>It further tended to place in the hands of irresponsible
people some control over the medical
management of hospital cases. If lay visitors can
enter a hospital and provide food for patients,
they may next wish to provide drugs, etc. It
seemed that the policy laid down in the first
instance was sound, useful, and healthy.</p>

<p>When the Commissioners took office they made a
number of changes in detail. They shifted the
position of the store; they printed different forms of
requisition, and they took the goods out of the
quartermaster's store and placed them in a store in the
hospital, presided over by a volunteer. The goods
were then obtained by requisition from the sisters and
the matron. But as the President of the Red Cross
Inquiry Court pointed out, with one trifling exception
the method was not really altered. The control had
simply ceased to be military, and had become civil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Consequently a large staff of capable people were withdrawn
from their ordinary occupations in Australia,
and devoted themselves to an administration which
had been hitherto effected entirely by the soldiers.
We do not think that the change was right or
desirable. It resulted in the creation of another body,
not responsible directly to the military authorities, to
do what is after all subsidiary work. The inevitable
tendency will be for the Red Cross to take on
function after function which should be undertaken
by military authorities. The Red Cross is already
supplying many articles which should be, and can
be, supplied by Ordnance. For there is nothing
that the Red Cross can supply that Ordnance cannot
still more easily supply. It is quite true that the
British Red Cross is managed on civil lines, and
the British Red Cross supplies goods and does not
supply money. But with a full knowledge of both
systems we are strongly of opinion that the military
method of management is in every respect preferable.</p>

<p>During the Red Cross Inquiry recently finished, to
which allusion will be made elsewhere, day after day
was necessarily spent by the Court in endeavouring
to decide what Red Cross should supply and what
Ordnance should supply. What does it matter so
long as the patient receives the articles? It does not
concern him where they come from, and if the whole
is under military control there is no need for this sharp
and artificial line of demarcation. We are of opinion
that in general the functions of the Red Cross should
be to supply those additional comforts and accessories
which make sick life more tolerable, to supply any
goods which may be donated, and to make helpful
donations of money in the way already indicated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>The presence in the store at Heliopolis of large
quantities of goods&mdash;sheets, blankets, pillows, and
the like&mdash;which could have been supplied by
Ordnance, enabled us to rapidly tide over a great
emergency. There is no doubt that the possession of
money and goods by the Red Cross will prove of vast
service in every campaign by reason of its emergency
value. In fact the rapid expansion of No. 1 General
Hospital during the crisis of May and June would
not have proceeded with such smooth expedition
had it not been for the large quantities of Red Cross
stores which lay to hand and were instantly passed
into the Quartermaster's department. If, however, the
supply had been under lay control, we can quite imagine
circumstances in which argument, requisitions, forms,
etc., might have seriously delayed operations.</p>

<p>Whilst on this subject reference must be made to
the help afforded to the hospitals by Red Cross
workers. Two schools of thought existed. Some
Commanding Officers preferred to have no helpers,
because of the trouble some of them gave. Others
passed to the other extreme. Our own experience
was that the workers organised by Mrs. Elgood were
most helpful for the functions they undertook, with
one or two exceptions, but those exceptional people
gave a certain amount of trouble. They came not
to help, but to criticise, and they carried their criticisms
not to the Commanding Officer, but to the
Australian public, and so caused trouble.</p>

<p>We are convinced that the Japanese method of
organising the Red Cross is sound. It is organised
and disciplined in time of peace, and when war is
declared it becomes part of the army medical reserve
and is mobilised for service. Every one is under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
military control, and consequently these crudities
are avoided. If we were to repeat our experience we
should have welcomed the visitors, but insisted that
they should be under some measure of discipline, and
that a serious breach of regulations should be followed
by their withdrawal. In some instances visitors
wrote to the Commander-in-Chief, and complained
of the food the patients were getting. The Commander-in-Chief
sent the letters on to us, and we
then brought the visitor in contact with the Commanding
Officer of the hospital, and the complaint
was investigated. How much more direct and
simple it would have been if the visitor who saw
something he believed to be wrong had immediately
asked for the Officer Commanding! But the
"secret and confidential" candid friend is apt to
become somewhat of a pest.</p>

<p>There is another and more serious aspect of the
matter. The medical officer is alone competent to
judge what food should be issued to patients.
Visitors who criticise the diet of the patient
are assuming a function which they are obviously
unable to discharge. Diet sheets are provided for
each ward, and on these is entered the number of
different diets prescribed by the medical officer.
These diet sheets should be the only and the final
authority of what should be issued to the patient in
the way of eatables. As it happened, ladies sometimes
brought into the different wards of the hospital
foods which constituted an added danger to
the patient. On one occasion green melons were
issued to a large number of sick men by kind-hearted
visitors. The men became so ill that the medical
officer confiscated the melons, made inquiries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
and only then ascertained the source of supply.
A strong-looking soldier on a milk diet might evoke
the sympathies of a lady visitor, who lodged
a complaint regarding the supply of food, but the
nature of his disease and the method of treatment
adopted by his medical officer are surely the
principal consideration. As everything conceivable
in the nature of food and drink can be supplied
through these diet sheets, the obvious course is to
pass all Red Cross foodstuffs directly into the
Quartermaster's department to be distributed in the
ordinary, and the only safe, channel. This was the
practice followed at Heliopolis.</p>

<p>The following articles were supplied in this way at
the time of expansion, and show what assistance a
properly controlled Red Cross system can render.</p>

<p class="center"><big><b>CHAPTER X</b></big></p>

<p>The experience gained in connection with the
establishment and extension of the First Australian
General Hospital suggests modifications which
should immensely increase efficiency. A base hospital
modelled on the R.A.M.C. pattern may work
exceedingly well in times of peace, or when staffed
by R.A.M.C. or I.M.S. officers who have devoted
their whole lives to the work. But base hospitals
constructed during a great war, and staffed almost
entirely with civilian elements the majority of whom
are untrained in administration of any kind, do not
work in all cases with the necessary degree of
smoothness. It certainly does appear that changes
in the base hospital establishment might be introduced
with advantage.</p>

<p>In the first place there arises the question whether
it is necessary for the Commanding Officer to be a
medical practitioner, or whether, as in the case of
the convalescent hospitals, he might be a combatant
officer, or at all events a non-medical officer. The
general consensus of opinion is that he should be
a medical officer, though there is a great deal to be
said on the other side. Almost the whole of his
work is administrative, though he necessarily must
have a good knowledge of clinical methods. But
unless such an officer be selected not simply with
regard to seniority, but with regard to experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
in administrative methods, and unless he be tactful
and watchful, troubles are very likely to ensue. His
task is beset with difficulties if he possesses character
and insists on efficiency. Whatever doubt there may
be, however, about the Commanding Officer, there
need be none about many of the other positions.
A noteworthy feature of the First Australian
General Hospital was the continual complaint from
the medical officers that they had not come away
to do administrative work. This distaste for administrative
work was a constant source of trouble.</p>

<p>The Registrar, as the principal executive officer of
the hospital, whose business it is to carry out the
decisions of the Commanding Officer, is at present
invariably a medical officer. The greater part of his
work does not need medical knowledge, and the
difficulty might be obviated by the adoption of one
of two methods. Either the Registrar might be an
educated business man or he might have such a one
as his immediate understudy. In the latter event a
very small portion of his day would be taken up
with the duties of the Registrar's office.</p>

<p>Similarly the orderly officer, whose business it is
to deal with details concerning the rank and file, is
usually a medical officer, and in some hospitals it
is the practice to change this officer from day to
day. At No. 1 General Hospital, however, his
functions were so important that one medical officer
was permanently told off to do this work. There
is no doubt that the orderly officer need not be a
medical officer, and might well be an invalided
combatant officer, transferred to the army medical
service.</p>

<p>Owing to modern developments another officer has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
made his appearance who is not provided for in any
establishment&mdash;that is, the transport officer. Motor
transport has become so large a portion of the work
of the base hospital that a special officer is requisite
for the purpose. There is no reason whatever why
such an officer should be a medical man.</p>

<p>If these changes were made it would result
in releasing at least three officers for clinical
purposes.</p>

<p>The amount of clerical work that was necessitated
by the returns furnished to the War Office,
the Australian Government, Headquarters Egypt,
and other departments was so great that a large staff
of very competent clerks was required. The future
establishment should certainly include not only
a number of trained stenographers, but some one
versed in statistical work. The lessons to be learned
are so numerous and so important that something
of the kind should be done. Furthermore, in
the Quartermaster's department there was a demand
not only for stenographers, but for men who
had been accustomed to the methodical ways of a
large warehouse.</p>

<p>Were all these changes made there is no doubt
that the efficiency of the administration would be
increased and the burden of the work lightened.</p>

<p>As regards clinical work other desirable changes
might be made. Senior men who have been
in full practice, and who come to a base hospital
as physicians or surgeons with the rank of lieutenant-colonel,
are apt to be entrusted with the
detailed administration of medical or surgical
wards. They are often unfitted by training for
such administration and are frequently disinclined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
to undertake the work. It would be far better
to leave the actual detailed administration of the
wards in the hands of a comparatively junior man
with the rank of major, and to retain these senior
officers as consultants only. Consultants of course
possess great powers, since their authority as regards
the clinical work itself is absolute. They can do
as much or as little as they like, but they are in
complete control and are absolutely responsible for
the treatment of the cases. Our own feeling is that
in such a position they would be far more comfortable
and would be more efficient.</p>

<p>On the subject of specialists there is much to be
said. It is almost incredible that a base hospital
should have been formed without being provided with
an ophthalmic and aural specialist. The change has
been made since war began, but it seems inconceivable
that any one should have contemplated the
efficient handling of wounds and diseases without
such aid. At the First General Hospital the ophthalmic
and aural department was the largest and most
heavily worked department in the hospital, partly
owing to the fact that one of us had been appointed
Consulting Oculist to the Forces in Egypt, and
that much of the work consequently centred at
Heliopolis.</p>

<p>Similarly the failure of the Australian Government
to provide dentists in the first instance is
difficult to understand. The day has gone by when
it is possible to exclude from the force a man who
possesses dentures or defective teeth, and it is
practically impossible to complete the work for the
recruits before they leave. So it became necessary
at No. 1 General Hospital to borrow two dentists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
from the New Zealand Government, to fit them
out with Red Cross money and goods, and in
this way to meet informally the difficulty. Subsequently
the Australian Government appointed a
corps of dentists, and the problem was to some
extent solved, though even now the demand far exceeds
the supply. There is no doubt that dentists
are wanted not only at the base hospitals, but also
near the firing line, as the dispatch of a man from
the firing line to the base hospital to obtain dental
treatment represents a waste of time and money.</p>

<p>It is further desirable to attach one or more
anæsthetists to every hospital.</p>

<p>It must, however, be said that the constant
changes of staff which took place at No. 1 Hospital
owing to the various exigencies of the military
situation rendered it extremely difficult to keep a
physician or surgeon in any fixed position for any
length of time. Consequently a certain amount of
pliability and adaptability was absolutely necessary.
At the same time, if the organisation were sketched
in the manner indicated, the problem would have
been more simple, and good results easier to obtain.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that one medical officer (who
could be attached to the Pathological Laboratory in
addition to the Clinical Pathologist) should devote
himself entirely to sanitary work. This duty is not
taken too seriously, and should be emphasised. It
would really be better to rename this officer the
"Prophylactic Officer," unless a better term can be
found, and it should be his aim and duty, not simply
to enforce cleanliness, but to actively exert himself
to ward off disease.</p>

<p>Stress may be laid on the usefulness of a sensible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
chaplain, whose value depends on his own interpretation
of his duties. The chaplain (Colonel Kendrew)
at No. 1 General Hospital not only attended to the
religious needs of men, but earned their affection
and respect by managing the extensive post office
and library, the canteen, and by helping with Red
Cross work. It is just these badly defined functions
in a base hospital which a chaplain can discharge
so well.</p>

<p>We think also that women might be used in base
hospitals as stenographers, ward maids, telephone
operators, and the like. Base hospitals in the future
are not likely to be housed in tents, and under rough
conditions. At present, trained nurses are sent to
the Stationary Hospitals. It seems a pity to waste
fine young men, who could be combatants, as orderlies
in a base hospital.</p>

<p>Masseurs are certainly badly wanted in a base
hospital, and it is difficult to understand the objection
to their incorporation. The difficulty was
removed in Egypt by employing Egyptians.</p>

<p>Electricians, <i>i.e.</i> orderlies who in civil life are
electricians, are required in every base hospital,
and at Heliopolis they were invaluable for general
purposes, and as aids to the radiographer. They
should, however, form part of the establishment,
and should number two or three.</p>

<p>Is it not clear that chefs, laundrymen, skilled
carpenters, and other tradesmen are also required?</p>

<p>The table which follows represents the establishment
of the ordinary 520-bed hospital, R.A.M.C.
It has been adopted by Australia, but the Australian
establishment allows for 93 nurses instead of 43.
If the foregoing suggestions are adopted, as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
think they should be, this table would require
material alteration.<br /></p>

<p>With reference to the duties of N.C.O.s and men,
nothing gave more trouble than the fact that men
recruited in Australia were made N.C.O.s before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
their special qualifications were known. There is
no officer in the Army whose position is so thoroughly
safeguarded as the N.C.O., and nothing but the
adverse decision of a court martial can effect his
removal. Yet an unsuitable and even dangerous
man, from the point of view of the sick, may do
nothing to warrant a court martial (which no one
enjoys). These appointments should be made therefore
with great care. Such considerations, of course,
lead to but one conclusion, viz. the necessity for
sketching out these hospitals in time of peace.
Scratch enlistments are too dangerous.</p>

<p>The "grouser" is always with us, and sometimes
gives trouble. The particular Australian "grouse"
was that the Australian hospitals should have been
nearer the front than Cairo, and at last No. 3 Australian
General Hospital was placed at Mudros.</p>

<p>Now we have always understood that a large
base hospital cannot be placed far from a great
city. A city grows in a particular place for
natural reasons&mdash;water supply, lighting, transit,
etc. The hospital gets the benefit of all these
agencies, whereas it was necessary at Lemnos to
create them. The result was somewhat disastrous
as regards supplies, and might have been foreseen.</p>

<p>"Grousers" should stay at home, and exercise
their privileges there.</p>

<p>The difficulties of obtaining supplies by requisition
were easily surmounted at Heliopolis because
of the broad policy adopted by the Officer Commanding
the Australian Intermediate Base, Colonel
Sellheim, C.B.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>Ordnance cannot supply the varied requirements
of a group of expert medical officers during a
great war, and delays cause untold annoyance to
active men. On the other hand, it would never
do to give the staff a free hand to purchase when
and how it pleased.</p>

<p>The institution of "local purchase orders" met
the difficulty. The O.C. of the hospital sent in
a requisition for something which could not be
obtained from Ordnance, marking it "urgently
required." The A.D.M.S. endorsed it, or, if it were
an entirely new line, asked the D.M.S. to endorse it.
The Ordnance officer then issued a local purchase
order to the medical officer, who made the purchase.
The method combined a measure of control with
reasonable speed in execution.</p>

<p>We have no sympathy with the usual references
to military red-tape. If the administration is
competent, the military system is thoroughly sound
from the business point of view, and from the
standpoint of record difficult to improve on. It
may be at times a little cumbersome, but it is
much easier to fall in with it than to attempt
to effect alteration during war. We never had any
real difficulty with requisitions, although supplies
were sometimes withheld from us on grounds of
policy not disclosed at the moment.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the erratic changes of staff
were injurious. Some medical officers preferred the
front, others the base, and an attempt was made
to effect an orderly system of periodical exchange.
Orders, however, were continually arriving to send
so many medical officers, so many nurses, and so
many orderlies, here and there, with the result
that at the end of ten months the original medical
staff had disappeared, many of the nurses were new,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and so were most of the orderlies. Whenever there
was a shortage of staff near the front, the base
hospitals were depleted. These changes were inevitable
in the circumstances, but they emphasised
the value of the advice given by Colonel Manifold,
that there cannot be too many unattached
junior medical officers in a campaign.</p>

Commanding Luna Park No. 1 Auxiliary Hospital,

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Dear Colonel Ramsay Smith</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"Allow me to congratulate you upon the
admirable medical arrangements at Heliopolis, and
upon the excellent hospital you have established
there. One is at first disposed to say, 'How well
the building adapts itself to a hospital!' until the
true fact becomes revealed of the genius displayed
in converting a decidedly refractory building into
a place for the sick. You and your staff have done
wonders and have once more shown that in the land
of Egypt 'it is possible to make bricks without
straw.'</p>

<p>"Australia may well be proud of the part she has
played in this war, and I can pay no higher compliment
than by saying that the medical arrangements
of the Australian Army are as splendid as are the
fighting qualities of its men.</p>

<p>"Above all I was impressed with the energy and
enthusiasm with which the work at Heliopolis is
being carried on, with the ingenuity and resource
displayed at every turn, and with the thoroughness
that was manifest in every department of the vast
hospital.</p>

<p>"The generosity with which Australia has provided
motor ambulances for the whole country and
Red Cross stores for every one, British or French,
who has been in want of same is beyond all words.</p>

<p>"I only hope that the people of Australia will
come to know of the splendid manner in which their
wounded have been cared for, and of the noble
and generous work which the great colony has done
under the banner of the Red Cross.</p>

<p>"I am just off to the Dardanelles, and then
back to Cairo, but I felt that I must write and thank
you for your kindness in sending me those excellent
and interesting photographs, which I shall treasure,
and the memory of the interesting day I spent with
you at your wonderful hospital. I also thank you

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Dear Major Barrett</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"I have been away at the front or I should
have written to you sooner to thank you for the
interesting visit which you enabled Sir Frederick
Treves and myself to pay to your hospital and
stores. I enclose an extract of a report which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
made on May 25 to the Hon. Arthur Stanley,
Chairman of the British Red Cross Society and Order
of St. John in London.</p>

<p>"You may have noticed a minute published in
the press with the approval of the G.O.C., Sir John
Maxwell, in which it was laid down that all Red
Cross work, except the Australian Red Cross work,
should be under the control of the British Red Cross
and Order of St. John. I hope you will not think
that in drafting this minute in this way I wished
to convey that we were not working in perfect
harmony with your Red Cross, but I feel that we
could hardly suggest to you that you should be
in any way under our control. At the same time,
I hope that when you either come here, or when I
come back to Cairo, that we may have an opportunity
of conferring together so that we may so
co-ordinate as far as possible our mutual work.</p>

<p>"May I add that I went to the Dardanelles in
a transport with over a thousand of your brave
soldiers, many of whom were returning to the
Peninsula after having already been wounded. It
is impossible to speak too highly of their gallantry,
and of the splendid spirit they displayed. I need
not tell you that I heard of their fighting qualities
at the front, since their heroic deeds in this campaign
have already become a matter of history.</p>

Sir Courtauld Thomson, Chief Commissioner
of the British Red Cross and Order
of St. John, to the Hon. Arthur Stanley,
dated May 25, 1915.</span></p>

<p>"A striking feature in Cairo is the remarkable
work which is being done by the Australian Red
Cross. They have not only two exceptionally large
hospitals and the large convalescent home, but
they supply the motor transport for the wounded
for the whole of Egypt. They have also very
large Red Cross stores which they have brought
with them. With these articles they have been
more than generous, and I am informed that they
have given away to the hospitals for our own troops
something like 75 per cent. of whatever they had."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Extract from Corps Orders, March 28, 1915</span></p>

<p>"<i>Appreciation.</i>&mdash;The D.M.S. Egypt, who visited
the Hospital yesterday afternoon, has requested the
Officer Commanding to convey to the officers, nurses,
N.C.O.s, and men in the Hospital his appreciation
of the work done and the thorough character of the
organisation."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Extract from Corps Orders, May 1, 1915</span></p>

<p>"<i>Appreciation.</i>&mdash;The D.M.S. Egypt, Surgeon-General
Ford, witnessed the detraining of the
invalids who arrived here Wednesday evening. He
asked Major Barrett to convey to the Officer Commanding
his great appreciation of the excellence of
the arrangements and the efficient and quiet manner
in which the work was done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"He congratulates officers and men on the splendid
work they are doing and requests that it shall
be communicated to them in Corps Orders."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looking back, does it not seem essential that
these hospitals should have been formed, at all
events in outline, in time of peace? That their commanding
officers and essential staff should have been
marked out beforehand, so that on the declaration
of war the gaps could have been filled in from the
reserve without difficulty? Satisfactory appointments
are much less likely to be made in the turmoil
which follows the declaration of war than in the
atmosphere of deliberate calm which prevails in
time of peace. Had such an arrangement prevailed,
the First Australian General Hospital would certainly
never have been recruited from three States
distant from one another hundreds of miles.</p>

<p>Finally, Australian hospitals in time of war should
either be regarded as responsible solely to the
Australian military authorities and Government,
or handed over without reserve to the R.A.M.C.,
and placed entirely under the control of the British
authorities. Where two different authorities exist,
as in the case of the First General Hospital, a large
amount of trouble and delay is almost certain to ensue.
The adoption of the latter course is in our judgment
absolutely essential if efficiency is to be secured.</p>

<p>As is invariably the case, weaknesses in any
system are only revealed by costly experience. But
while in the Australian Medical Service the experience
need not have been so costly, we can at least
profit by what has occurred, and frame a stronger
and a better policy for the future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>On the whole, the record of work done in
most trying circumstances is, we think, satisfactory.
It is true that the universal democratic fault was
evidenced in the lack of preparation for conditions
which were fairly obvious. Nevertheless the adaptability
and growth of the hospitals in time of great
emergency were achievements of the highest order.</p>

<p>Yet it would be unwise to leave the subject
with the usual Anglo-Saxon expression of satisfaction
that the crisis was passed. The history
reviewed has too deep a significance. It must be
regarded not merely as an individual incident, but
as an indication of the inefficiency evidenced by
too many departments of the Empire.</p>

<p>The causes which found the medical services unprepared,
which forced them to expand to the breaking-point,
and which led to the criticism of the
hospital authorities, are not departmental or sectional&mdash;they
are national. If attacks on individuals are
permitted, initiative will be stifled; if on the other
hand we are content to follow the time-worn policy
of "muddling through," the virile people who
skirt the border lines of our Empire will sooner or
later bid us make way for stronger men.</p>

<p>Our policy for the future must be one of scientific
organisation and calculated preparation in every
department. We must not only appoint capable administrators,
but also trust them. We can again, if we
like, obtain that temporary mental tranquillity which
comes to a democracy&mdash;and to an ostrich&mdash;which
does not or will not see the calamity which threatens
it, but temporary beatitude will be purchased at
the price of an Empire. Never was it more certainly
true that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance.</p>

<p>One of us (J. W. B.) was invalided to England in
the middle of November 1915, and returned to Egypt
at the end of March 1916.</p>

<p>He resigned his commission in the Australian Army
Medical Corps on February 28, and was appointed
temporary Lt.-Col. in the R.A.M.C. on February 29.
On his return to Egypt he was appointed Consulting
Aurist to the Forces in Egypt, and was a member
of the Council of the British Red Cross Society and
of the Y.M.C.A. He consequently had an opportunity
of witnessing the termination of many of
the arrangements for which he had been in part
originally responsible, and desires to make brief
reference to them.</p>

<p>No. 1 Australian General Hospital with its many
off-shoots, including the four auxiliary hospitals and
the venereal disease hospital, was located in Egypt
for periods of twelve to eighteen months. No. 2
Australian General Hospital was in Egypt about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
fourteen months. Yet it was stated that each and
every one of these hospitals when established were
to be temporarily located in Egypt for a few weeks.
Luna Park, <i>i.e.</i> No. 1 Auxiliary Hospital, was in
existence approximately sixteen months. An enormous
number of sick and wounded, said to be 18,000,
was passed through it with an infinitesimal death-rate,
viz. four or five persons. Since the end of
1915, the No. 3 Australian General Hospital was
moved from Mudros to the Barracks at Abbassia,
Cairo. The expenditure necessary to fit the barracks
for the reception of No. 3 Australian General Hospital
and the time taken are very interesting, since
they show how utterly impossible any such arrangement
would have been during the inrush of wounded
in 1915. Stress is laid on the value of auxiliary
hospitals as the only practicable means of surmounting
difficulties at that time, in the report
of the Committee of Inquiry into the Administration
of the Australian Branch British Red Cross in
Egypt.</p>

<p>Looking back at the practical conclusion of the
work of the Australian Army Medical Corps in
Egypt, it is quite evident that the policy originally
adopted was the only one possible in the circumstances,
and the results have fully justified it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Fly Campaign</span></h3>

<p>Very active steps were taken during 1916 in the
direction of a campaign for the destruction of flies.
The only addition that need be made to previous
remarks is reference to the ingenious fly traps which
have been devised. A large one was designed by
Lt.-Col. Andrew Balfour, C.M.G., and is described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
in the journal of the Army Medical Corps of July
1916. A modified form of this trap, furnished by
the British Red Cross in Egypt, costs about 16<i>s.</i>,
and was most effective. These traps have been
known to catch as many as 20,000 flies a day.</p>

<p>The smaller trap, which can be used indoors, and
is made of zinc gauze, was made in large quantities
by the British Red Cross Society in Alexandria,
and distributed throughout Egypt.</p>

<p>Another kind of trap, a Japanese invention, with
clockwork mechanism, manufactured by Owari
Tokei, Kabushiki, Kwaisha, Japan, has also been
very successful. As many as 3,000 flies have been
captured in one instance in an hour. It has a
considerable advantage over the other traps in that
its mechanism interests everyone.</p>

<p>Like all fly traps, however, the utility of these
devices depends upon placing them in the hands of
men whose business it is to see that they are
properly baited and cared for, and on some ingenuity
with regard to the baits. For the larger traps
placed out-of-doors the best baits were found to
be fishes' heads or the entrails of fowls, whilst the
best bait for the smaller indoor trap was a mixture
of beer or whisky and sugar.</p>

<p>It is, of course, quite evident that the destruction
of flies by traps is not logically sound, since the
proper method of control of the fly pest is by the
destruction of all refuse; but as that is impracticable
in Egypt, the traps were of great assistance.</p>

<p>In 1916 the fly pest as usual became marked
during two periods in the year; viz. at the beginning
and the end of summer. At the height of
summer the dryness and desiccation evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
prevent the breeding of flies, a fact to be borne
in mind in Australia.</p>

<p>The returns given in the House of Commons respecting
the Gallipoli Campaign place the casualties
at 116,000, and the cases invalided at 96,000. As a
very large number of the cases of the sick were due
to intestinal infections, some idea of the damage
which may be caused by flies can be imagined.</p>

<p>The discovery of bilharzia eggs and the organisms
of dysentery and diarrh&oelig;a in the fæces of flies
made it clear that the fly plays an even larger
part in disseminating disease than has hitherto been
understood. It really would appear that if the
flies were destroyed infective diseases would fall to
small proportions.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Venereal-Disease Problem</span></h3>

<p>The venereal-disease problem in the early part
of 1916 gave very great concern, and active measures
were taken to deal with it. In spite of all the
ameliorating influences the problem reached its
most serious phase in March and April 1916, as
questions put in the House of Commons show (<i>vide</i>
<i>Lancet</i>, April 8, 1916). I think I express the conviction
of certainly 90 per cent. of medical men in
stating that nothing but education and educated
prophylaxis will ever enable us to get rid of this
source of destruction.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Y.M.C.A. and Red Cross</span></h3>

<p>The Soldiers' Club in the Ezbekieh Garden grew
in favour and was extended in area and staff. In the
autumn of 1915 some ladies became available, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
did splendid service in the superintendence of the
catering for the men in the Club, and by their
presence there did much to help.</p>

<p>A more extended experience of the work of the
Y.M.C.A. and of the Red Cross has given much
cause for thought. The Y.M.C.A. organisation
appears to me to be excellent, since it is the organisation
which caters for the social welfare of the
soldier, wherever he may be, whether in camp or
at the base; and the work is conducted by men
whose business it is to understand him and see that
all reasonable wants are gratified. In Egypt as I
write (July 1916) there are no fewer than forty-seven
Y.M.C.A. huts and centres, and Y.M.C.A. officers in
the desert, in the oases, and elsewhere, doing their
very best to make the soldiers comfortable. In other
words, the business of the Y.M.C.A. is to provide
comfort by personal service over and above military
necessaries for the men who are well.</p>

<p>The Red Cross Society, on the other hand, attends
to the wants of the sick and wounded, and its functions
have already been discussed. They may,
however, be supplemented by the following definition
of the work of the Red Cross which was furnished by
the High Commissioner for Egypt, Sir Henry
MacMahon:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Government supplies all the necessities for the
care, treatment, and transport of the sick and
wounded, while the Red Cross supplements these
necessities by everything that can in any way go to
the comfort and well-being of the sick and wounded
soldiers. The distinction between necessities and
comforts is sometimes so indefinite that the Red
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>Cross, wherever possible, endeavours to have both
ready to hand for use when needed."</p></blockquote>

<p>And later:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A word must be said here about the work of
the Red Cross Stores. The object of the Red Cross
has never been to supply in any large quantities the
goods which the War Office sends to the wounded,
but it does its best to provide the troops with such
things as the War Office does not supply at all or
cannot supply at a given time. A State Department,
bound as it rightly is by hard-and-fast rules,
cannot work as quickly as a private body with
more elastic regulations; moreover, the supplies
of any department may change at times, hence it
happens that the British Red Cross occasionally
supply certain things more than the War Office can,
or it may supplement the War Office supplies, and
it does so until the War Office steps in again. Further,
the Red Cross supplies many things or small luxuries
which the authorities cannot possibly supply, and
these are just the things which are most appreciated
by the sick and wounded."</p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, the function of the Red Cross is
to assist over and above necessity, and to be ready
to act in event of emergency.</p>

<p>The following lists of the Australian Branch and
Egyptian Branch of the British Red Cross show that
in both cases, but particularly in the case of the
Australian Branch, the Red Cross is supplying
articles which should clearly be supplied by Government.
There is considerable danger in allowing this
system to become too largely developed. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
first place in the case of the Red Cross there is no
rigid system of accountancy such as military regulation
requires, and the natural tendency for commanders
will be to get goods in the easiest possible
manner; nevertheless, it may not be the best thing
for the service.</p>

<p>The British Red Cross safeguards the practice
more fully than the younger branch, and its lead
might well be followed. (See Lists on pp. <a href="#Page_212">212</a>-<a href="#Page_216">216</a>.)</p>

<p>will only be provided by the British Red Cross on the understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
that the Military Departments have been applied to
and cannot supply, or that it is a case of grave or unexpected
emergency. Such a demand to be supported by signature of
O.C. Hospital, which implies he has indented on the department
concerned and failed to obtain.</p>

<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;<i>All indents to be countersigned by the O.C. Hospital.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The British Red Cross has definitely been placed
under military control, and the Chief Commissioner
has been attached to the staff of the Commander-in-Chief.
The work goes on just as usual, but if necessity
arose the Commander-in-Chief could exercise
his authority.</p>

<p>I understand that in France the Australian Branch
British Red Cross has now been placed under
military control; the Director of Medical Services,
Australian Expeditionary Force, being Chief Commissioner
and the other commissioners and officers
being graded with various ranks. To me this
arrangement is definitely a step in the right direction,
though I still think the British system in
Egypt is better. The officers of the Red Cross in
Egypt have no rank, but are under military direction,
and the Chief Civil Commissioner is attached
to the staff of the Commander-in-Chief; he has had
the rank of Hon. Colonel since the war began. It is
interesting, however, to note that the Australian
Branch British Red Cross has passed through four
phases, so far as the work in the field is concerned:</p>

<p>(1) It was a purely military organisation.</p>

<p>(2) When the High Commissioner in Egypt was
requested to form a committee it became a combined
civil and military organisation.</p>

<p>(3) When the Australian commissioners were
appointed it became a purely civil administration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>(4) It has finally become a combined civil and
military organisation, in which the military element
holds control.</p>

<p>This step further indicates the logical development,
in my judgment, of both the Y.M.C.A. and the Red
Cross. They should both be regarded as definite
branches of the service. They should both be
organised in time of peace largely as independent
organisations, and as part of the Reserve, and, on
declaration of war, they should be incorporated in
the service and placed under military control. The
function of the one would be to attend to the social
wants of the men who are well, the other to attend
to the wants of the men who are sick and wounded.</p>

<p>I do not think that any other funds or societies
should be permitted to interfere with military
arrangements; all those who desire to help with
money, with goods, or with personal assistance could
do so through the one channel or the other.</p>

<p>As a corollary to the foregoing it is evident that
there should be only one voluntary war fund, which
should be placed under the control of a committee
representing the Y.M.C.A., the Red Cross, and
nominees of the Government and public, who could
allocate the money subscribed to the Y.M.C.A.
or Red Cross as necessity arose. The following list
shows the unnecessary multiplicity of organisations
and funds in the State of Victoria alone, viz. at least
seventeen societies in a community of about one
million and a half people. Even in Egypt enthusiastic
people started an "Australian Comforts
Fund," a "Soldiers' Outings Association," "Camp
Welfare Association," and so forth, and these bodies
simply did for varying periods the work of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Y.M.C.A. or the Red Cross as the case may be, in
a more or less patchy way.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="center">MULTIPLICITY OF FUNDS<br />
(<i>From "The Argus," Melbourne, 1916</i>)<br />
<br />
"WAR RELIEF FUNDS<br />
"<span class="smcap">Objects Outlined: A Guide to Giving</span><br />
</div>

<p>"It is only when one sees the complete list of war
relief funds compiled by the State War Council, in
connection with its announcement regarding the
supervision to be exercised over future collections,
that the full extent of the relief organisations and
the wide scope covered by the Victorian public's
generous giving are appreciated. There are in
existence here a score of war funds of one kind or
another, and by the devoted efforts of their organisers
and the warm-hearted support of the public
the lot of our soldiers has been brightened, the
burden of pain and suffering borne by the sick and
wounded has been eased, a helping hand has been
extended to the homeless, broken sufferers of Belgium,
Poland, and Serbia, and a gleam of happiness brought
to many a home in France whose erstwhile bread-winner
is on active service.</p>

<p>"All the Victorian organisations have clearly
defined objects, and are working along sound lines.
The list of funds is to be increased shortly by the
creation of a Repatriation Fund the details of which
are now being worked out. The money raised will
be devoted to the settling in suitable employment
of soldiers who have fulfilled their service. A
similar object is aimed at in the repatriation scheme
which has been launched with such marked success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
by Mr. Rodgers, M.H.R. The objects of the other

</blockquote>

<p>An additional advantage of the arrangements proposed
would be that all those who assist would be
under a measure of discipline. Neither men nor
women helpers should be permitted to enter the
war zone unless they visit it with a serious purpose
and an earnest desire to help. If they enter in this
frame of mind they will have no objection to submitting
to discipline. If they object it is far better
for them to stay at home.</p>

<p>It is furthermore apparent that Red Cross workers
should be limited to elderly men of experience or
younger men who are physically defective. In the
case of the Y.M.C.A. young and healthy men are
required, since their work is very arduous, the
living at times rough to a degree, and there is
not inconsiderable personal risk undertaken by
those who are placed in advanced positions. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
national wars every healthy adult is of great value
as a soldier, and it is necessary to see that as few
of such men as possible are utilised in these auxiliary
services.</p>

<p>If the arrangements here indicated had been
carried into effect, the work in Egypt would have
been much better done and the activities of the
Y.M.C.A. would have prevented a vast amount of
trouble and disease. As it was, the value of the
Y.M.C.A. was not apparent to the public at first,
since its activities are not so dramatic as those of
the Red Cross Society, and funds have never been
provided for it on anything like the same scale.</p>

<p>In conclusion, with regard to the Australian
Branch British Red Cross, there is something more
to be said. As its name implies, the Australian Red
Cross is a branch of the British Red Cross Society,
and yet we have experienced in Egypt the spectacle
of the Egyptian Branch and the Australian Branch
of the same society doing the same work for different
sections of troops engaged in a common cause.
There were two Red Cross stores in Cairo,
Australian and British, two stores in Alexandria,
and two in Mudros. Would it not have been
much better to amalgamate the two branches and
administer the Red Cross in Egypt as a whole? The
separation served no good material purpose, and
whilst by the exercise of good sense some of the
difficulties arising from the dual arrangement were
obviated, yet this evidence of particularism was
not advantageous.</p>

<p>Vast quantities of goods were donated to the
Australian Troops by the Comforts Fund, and vast
quantities of goods were given to soldiers in hospitals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
and convalescent homes by the Australian Branch
British Red Cross. As evidence of soundness of
heart on the part of the Australian public this action
was beyond praise, but it is doubtful whether the
methods were the best which might be devised. The
generosity of the public lent itself to some abuse,
and soldiers are known to have sold these goods to
Arabs, and employed the cash as they pleased. It is
difficult to draw a healthy mean between strict
administration with proper restriction and lavish
administration and abuse. It is doubtful to me
whether it would not better conserve the self-respect
of the soldier and be more dignified if these donations
were to cease. In their place proper facilities
might well be substituted for the purchase of such
articles as the soldier required at very low prices.
This is the plan followed by the Y.M.C.A., who
never divorce personal service from any distribution
of goods. If the pay of the Australian soldier&mdash;which
by the way is the highest in the world&mdash;is
thought insufficient, it could be increased by
voluntary help conveyed through the proper official
channels. If this system were adopted it would
necessitate the appointment of a Y.M.C.A. and
of a Red Cross officer to certain defined military
units, and a well-organised method would at once
make its appearance; in other words, we should substitute
sympathetic order and justice for amateurish
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Does not the necessity for the foregoing criticism
indicate our utter unpreparedness? For if we had
possessed a national organisation for Peace and
War, each and all of these problems would have been
solved long ago, and we should have been spared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the spectacle of willing helpers wasting their energy
for lack of direction.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Prevention of Disease</span></h3>

<p>Surveying the whole campaign, the fundamental
fault of the Australian Army Medical Service was
the insufficient attention given to, and stress laid
on, the prevention of disease. Is it not obvious
that there should be a staff of medical officers and
orderlies, detached altogether from any association
with the treatment of disease, who should devote
themselves entirely to the problem of prevention?
This staff should be presided over by a Surgeon-General
who should be second only in rank to the
Director of Medical Services in the field, and who
with his staff should be armed with authority so far
as the taking of steps for the prevention of disease
is concerned. At present the medical officers in
the Australian Medical Service are entrusted with
dual functions, the prevention and the treatment
of disease.</p>

<p>So far there has been no Military School for
medical officers in Australia, and until they are
properly trained the prevention of disease will not
be as effective as it might be.</p>

<p>In the Royal Army Medical Corps there is a
Sanitary Staff, but it does not seem to me that
even this highly trained body occupies the high
position or enjoys the distinction that the value
of its services really demand, and I cannot but think
that it would be far better to abolish the term
"sanitary" and to apply to it the term "Prophylactic
Staff."</p>

<p>The cure of disease in civil life always attracts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the public; it is dramatic and strikes the attention.
The efforts of the men who obviate the necessity for
anything of the kind never receive the same recognition,
because the evil never becomes obvious.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Conditions of Recruits on Arrival</span></h3>

<p>Captain Lovegrove, A.A.M.C., was appointed
Australian Embarkation Officer at Suez whilst I was
in charge. He has contributed the following article
to <i>The Australian Medical Journal</i> relative to the
work he did during his ten months' stay.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="center">"MEDICAL NOTES ON TROOPS FROM AUSTRALIA<br />
LANDING AT SUEZ<br />
<br />
"<span class="smcap">By Frederick Lovegrove</span>, M.B., Ch.B.(<i>Melb.</i>), <i>Captain
A.A.M.C., Australia</i><br />
</div>

<p>"During ten months' tenure of the unique appointment
of Australian Embarkation Medical Officer, I
have had peculiar opportunities of observing the
condition of our soldiers arriving in Egypt.</p>

<p>"The physique of our men has always excited the
admiration of the British and Indian officers who
have watched them disembark, and if an excess of
high spirits in the troops has occasionally given an
opportunity for military criticism, from a medical
point of view this sign of robust health is altogether
satisfactory.</p>

<p>"The time of the voyage to Egypt from Melbourne
averages thirty days; but, owing to delays at ports
of call, many of the troops spend five weeks or more
on board ship. The fact that the death-rate is so low
and the condition of the men so good on arrival
speaks highly for the arrangements on the ships and
the watchful care of the medical officers on transport<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
duty. A few accidents and an occasional case of
appendicitis form the bulk of the cases removed to
general wards of Suez Hospital.</p>

<p>"Infectious disease, however, has occurred on a
large number of vessels, and it has been possible to
form some opinion of the epidemics present in the
various camps in Australia, by noting the prevalent
type of infectious disease on ships from different
States.</p>

<p>"(1) Influenza has been far and away the most
common complaint. Though some of the patients
are still febrile on arrival, and are sent to hospital
here, the epidemic is usually spent before Egypt is
reached.</p>

<p>"(2) Pneumonia is occasionally severe, and is
usually associated with an epidemic of influenza.
Twelve months ago a certain percentage of cases
developed empyema; for many months now there
have been no cases of this kind.</p>

<p>"(3) Measles has been chiefly found among Victorian
troops, and has been represented every month.
South Australia has sent its quota during April and
May. In some cases the epidemic has been wide-spread
at first, and has worked itself out before
arrival. In other cases a few men have been picked
out early and isolated, and no epidemic has occurred.
Occasionally a ship has arrived with a large number
of cases, evidently originating after embarkation
from some unrecognised case on board.</p>

<p>"(4) Mumps has been represented largely every
month. This disease is practically a perquisite of
New South Wales and Queensland troops. The long
incubation period and impossibility of recognising
the disease in an early stage makes a general ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
infection the rule, and the epidemic is usually at its
height when the troops arrive here.</p>

<p>"(5) Cerebro-spinal meningitis has not occurred
as an epidemic, but has appeared on the returns every
month, with one or two cases. Victoria has contributed
the largest number of cases, except in November
and January, when New South Wales supplied
the largest number. Victoria has had a monopoly
for the past four months.</p>

<p>"(6) Enteric fever has been remarkable by its
rarity. Ten cases only have been noted; of which
New South Wales contributed six, five from one
ship; Victoria one in each of the months of September,
November, and December; and South Australia
one in December. No cases have occurred this year.</p>

<p>"Chicken-pox, scarlet fever, and roetheln have
occasioned no trouble here. Small-pox, plague, or
cholera have not occurred among troops on Australian
transports.</p>

<p>"(7) Venereal disease. While the percentage of
troops arriving in Egypt with venereal disease is not
high&mdash;the actual figure is 0·75 per cent.&mdash;the total
number of effectives withdrawn from combatant
duty owing to this cause is sufficiently large to
make the subject one of importance. In ten
months 530 men with gonorrh&oelig;a and 90 men with
syphilis have had to go to hospital immediately on
arrival. Soft sores have almost always been cured
on the voyage, so that practically all chancres seen
here are syphilitic. By far the greatest number of
syphilitic cases hail from Queensland and New
South Wales, and while gonorrh&oelig;a is the main
feature of Victorian venereal cases, the two previously
mentioned States take the precedence here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
also. A rise in the numbers from Western Australia
has lately been noticed. This may possibly be due
to the fact that men from other States found to be
suffering from venereal diseases while crossing the
Bight are landed in Western Australia. There is a
general rise in the proportion of syphilis to gonorrh&oelig;a,
and this is particularly noticeable among Queensland
troops, where the general ratio of one syphilis to six
gonorrh&oelig;a is now more like one to one, and occasionally
the cases of gonorrh&oelig;a are outnumbered by
syphilis."</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><span class="smcap">Hospital Organisation</span></h3>

<p>With extended experience the views of the writer
on the subject of the organisation of military hospitals
have crystallised. There is no doubt that the
commander of a hospital must be a medical practitioner,
and there is no doubt that in all matters
relating to his hospital his authority must be final.
In the last resort he must decide whether a patient
is to leave the hospital or to stay; who should be
admitted, and what the treatment should be. In a
good organisation he will probably be very rarely
required to express an opinion respecting these
matters, but in the event of a conflict of opinion
between say the consulting surgeon or physician
and himself, there can be but one final arbitrament.
The position is defined in the King's Regulations
and is endorsed by common sense. So far as the
Registrar is concerned I think that he should be a
medical practitioner, but that in every instance there
should be an assistant registrar with the rank of
lieutenant, who should do the whole of the detailed
work connected with the records, and who need not
necessarily be a medical officer. In like manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the Transport Officer and the Orderly Officer or
Adjutant should be of the same character and rank.
Difficulty, however, arises respecting the personnel
of these non-medical offices. It is clear that, for
purposes of discipline, they should belong to the
Army Medical Corps and be under the control of
the officer commanding. In time of war there is
no doubt that invalided combatant officers would do
very well, but no combatant officer would want such
a position in time of peace, because there would
be no subsequent career available. To effect a satisfactory
solution of the problem it would be necessary
to add to the establishment of a base hospital three
non-medical commissioned officers of the same rank
as the Quartermaster, preferably former Sergt.-Majors
who have obtained commissions and who
consequently know the details of hospital administration
thoroughly. There would then be in each
base hospital four non-medical commissioned officers,
viz. the Quartermaster, the Asst. Registrar, the
Orderly Officer, and the Transport Officer, and all
would belong to the A.M.C. A hospital suitably
staffed on this plan would run very smoothly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Assistance of Anglo-Egyptians</span></h3>

<p>Surveying the work of the Australian Army Medical
Corps in Egypt, it does seem to me that sufficient
acknowledgment has not been made of the services
rendered and the help given to the Australian sick
and wounded by the British residents in Egypt,
who, from their Excellencies Sir Henry and Lady
MacMahon downwards, spared no effort to help
wherever assistance was possible. Very many of
the officials employed in the Egyptian Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
service came to the hospitals when the day's work
was over and worked till late in the night, rendering
services which freed the orderlies for other
special duty. It was impossible to get reinforcements
with any rapidity, the pressure was enormous,
and the least that can be said is that these ladies and
gentlemen are entitled to respectful and grateful
acknowledgment from the people of Australia.</p>

<p>Special acknowledgment also should be made of
the sympathetic help given by the courteous and
able officers of the Egyptian State Railways.</p>

<p>I do not think it will be right to close the work
without personal acknowledgment of the exceedingly
valuable help given in a time of crisis by the ladies
and gentlemen whose names are attached, and who,
at great inconvenience, came forward at the time
when other help was unobtainable.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX I</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">The Wounded and Sick</span></div>

<h4><i>Article 1</i></h4>

<p>Officers and soldiers, and other persons officially attached to
armies, shall be respected and taken care of when wounded or
sick by the belligerent in whose power they may be, without
distinction of nationality.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a belligerent who is compelled to abandon sick
or wounded to the enemy shall, as far as military exigencies
permit, leave with them a portion of his medical <i>personnel</i> and
material to contribute to the care of them.</p>


<h4><i>Article 2</i></h4>

<p>Except as regards the treatment to be provided for them in
virtue of the preceding article, the wounded and sick of an army
who fall into the hands of an enemy are prisoners of war, and
the general provisions of international law concerning prisoners
are applicable to them.</p>

<p>Belligerents are, however, free to arrange with one another
such exceptions and mitigations with reference to sick and
wounded prisoners as they may judge expedient; in particular,
they will be at liberty to agree&mdash;</p>

<p>To restore to one another the wounded left on the field after
a battle;</p>

<p>To repatriate any wounded and sick whom they do not wish to
retain as prisoners, after rendering them fit for removal or after
recovery;</p>

<p>To hand over to a neutral State, with the latter's consent,
the enemy's wounded and sick to be interned by the neutral
State until the end of hostilities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>


<h4><i>Article 3</i></h4>

<p>After each engagement the Commander in possession of the
field shall take measures to search for the wounded, and to ensure
protection against pillage and maltreatment both for the wounded
and for the dead.</p>

<p>He shall arrange that a careful examination of the bodies is
made before the dead are buried or cremated.</p>


<h4><i>Article 4</i></h4>

<p>As early as possible each belligerent shall send to the authorities
of the country or army to which they belong the military
identification marks or tokens found on the dead, and a nominal
roll of the wounded or sick who have been collected by him.</p>

<p>The belligerents shall keep each other mutually informed of
any internments and changes, as well as of admissions into
hospital and deaths among the wounded and sick in their hands.
They shall collect all the articles of personal use, valuables,
letters, etc., which are found on the field of battle or left by the
wounded or sick who have died in the medical establishments
or units, in order that such objects may be transmitted to the
persons interested by the authorities of their own country.</p>


<h4><i>Article 5</i></h4>

<p>The competent military authority may appeal to the charitable
zeal of the inhabitants to collect and take care of, under his
direction, the wounded or sick of armies, granting to those who
respond to the appeal special protection and certain immunities.</p>



<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Medical Units and Establishments</span></div>


<h4><i>Article 6</i></h4>

<p>Mobile medical units (that is to say, those which are intended
to accompany armies into the field) and the fixed establishments
of the medical service shall be respected and protected by the
belligerents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>


<h4><i>Article 7</i></h4>

<p>The protection to which medical units and establishments are
entitled ceases if they are made use of to commit acts harmful
to the enemy.</p>


<h4><i>Article 8</i></h4>

<p>The following facts are not considered to be of a nature to
deprive a medical unit or establishment of the protection guaranteed
by Article 6:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That the <i>personnel</i> of the unit or of the establishment is
armed, and that it uses its arms for its own defence or for that of
the sick and wounded under its charge.</p>

<p>2. That in default of armed orderlies the unit or establishment
is guarded by a picquet or by sentinels furnished with an authority
in due form.</p>

<p>3. That weapons and cartridges taken from the wounded and
not yet handed over to the proper department are found in the
unit or establishment.</p>



<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Personnel</span></div>


<h4><i>Article 9</i></h4>

<p>The <i>personnel</i> engaged exclusively in the collection, transport,
and treatment of the wounded and the sick, as well as in the
administration of medical units and establishments, and the
Chaplains attached to armies, shall be respected and protected
under all circumstances. If they fall into the hands of the enemy
they shall not be treated as prisoners of war.</p>

<p>These provisions apply to the guard of medical units and
establishments under the circumstances indicated in Article 8 (2).</p>


<h4><i>Article 10</i></h4>

<p>The <i>personnel</i> of Voluntary Aid Societies, duly recognised and
authorised by their Government, who may be employed in the
medical units and establishments of armies, is placed on the same
footing as the <i>personnel</i> referred to in the preceding article,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
provided always that the first-mentioned <i>personnel</i> shall be
subject to military law and regulations.</p>

<p>Each State shall notify to the other, either in time of peace or
at the commencement of or during the course of hostilities, but
in every case before actually employing them, the names of the
societies which it has authorised, under its responsibility, to
render assistance to the regular medical service of its armies.</p>


<h4><i>Article 11</i></h4>

<p>A recognised society of a neutral country can only afford the
assistance of its medical <i>personnel</i> and units to a belligerent with
the previous consent of its own Government and the authorisation
of the belligerent concerned.</p>

<p>A belligerent who accepts such assistance is bound to notify
the fact to his adversary before making any use of it.</p>


<h4><i>Article 12</i></h4>

<p>The persons designated in Articles 9, 10, and 11, after they
have fallen into the hands of the enemy, shall continue to carry
on their duties under his direction.</p>

<p>When their assistance is no longer indispensable, they shall be
sent back to their army or to their country at such time and by
such route as may be compatible with military exigencies.</p>

<p>They shall then take with them such effects, instruments,
arms, and horses as are their private property.</p>


<h4><i>Article 13</i></h4>

<p>The enemy shall secure to the persons mentioned in Article 9,
while in his hands, the same allowances and the same pay as are
granted to the persons holding the same rank in his own army.</p>



<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Material</span></div>


<h4><i>Article 14</i></h4>

<p>If mobile medical units fall into the hands of the enemy they
shall retain their material, including their teams, irrespectively
of the means of transport and the drivers employed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, the competent military authority shall be free
to use the material for the treatment of the wounded and sick.
It shall be restored under the conditions laid down for the medical
<i>personnel</i>, and so far as possible at the same time.</p>


<h4><i>Article 15</i></h4>

<p>The buildings and material of fixed establishments remain
subject to the laws of war, but may not be diverted from their
purpose so long as they are necessary for the wounded and the
sick.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Commanders of troops in the field may
dispose of them, in case of urgent military necessity, provided
they make previous arrangements for the welfare of the wounded
and sick who are found there.</p>


<h4><i>Article 16</i></h4>

<p>The material of Voluntary Aid Societies which are admitted
to the privileges of the Convention under the conditions laid down
therein is considered private property, and as such to be respected
under all circumstances, saving only the right of requisition
recognised for belligerents in accordance with the laws and
customs of war.</p>



<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Convoys of Evacuation</span></div>


<h4><i>Article 17</i></h4>

<p>Convoys of evacuation shall be treated like mobile medical
units subject to the following special provisions:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. A belligerent intercepting a convoy may break it up if
military exigencies demand, provided he takes charge of the
sick and wounded who are in it.</p>

<p>2. In this case, the obligation to send back the medical <i>personnel</i>,
provided for in Article 12, shall be extended to the whole
of the military <i>personnel</i> detailed for the transport or the protection
of the convoy, and furnished with an authority in due form
to that effect.</p>

<p>The obligation to restore the medical material, provided for in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Article 14, shall apply to railway trains, and boats used in internal
navigation, which are specially arranged for evacuations, as well
as to the material belonging to the medical service for fitting
up ordinary vehicles, trains, and boats.</p>

<p>Military vehicles other than those of the medical service may
be captured with their teams.</p>

<p>The civilian <i>personnel</i> and the various means of transport
obtained by requisition, including railway material and boats
used for convoys, shall be subject to the general rules of international
law.</p>



<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">The Distinctive Emblem</span></div>


<h4><i>Article 18</i></h4>

<p>As a compliment to Switzerland, the heraldic emblem of the
red cross on a white ground, formed by reversing the Federal
colours, is retained as the emblem and distinctive sign of the
medical service of armies.</p>


<h4><i>Article 19</i></h4>

<p>With the permission of the competent military authority, this
emblem shall be shown on the flags and armlets (<i>brassards</i>), as
well as on all the material belonging to the Medical Service.</p>


<h4><i>Article 20</i></h4>

<p>The <i>personnel</i> protected in pursuance of Articles 9 (paragraph
1), 10, and 11 shall wear, fixed to the left arm, an armlet (<i>brassard</i>),
with a red cross on a white ground, delivered and stamped
by the competent military authority, and accompanied by a
certificate of identity in the case of persons who are attached
to the medical service of armies, but who have not a military
uniform.</p>


<h4><i>Article 21</i></h4>

<p>The distinctive flag of the Convention shall only be hoisted
over those medical units and establishments which are entitled
to be respected under the Convention, and with the consent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
of the military authorities. It must be accompanied by the
national flag of the belligerent to whom the unit or establishment
belongs.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, medical units which have fallen into the hands
of the enemy, so long as they are in that situation, shall not fly
any other flag than that of the Red Cross.</p>


<h4><i>Article 22</i></h4>

<p>The medical units belonging to neutral countries which may
be authorised to afford their services under the conditions laid
down in Article 11 shall fly, along with the flag of the Convention,
the national flag of the belligerent to whose army they are
attached.</p>

<p>The provisions of the second paragraph of the preceding article
are applicable to them.</p>


<h4><i>Article 23</i></h4>

<p>The emblem of the red cross on a white ground and the words
"Red Cross" or "Geneva Cross" shall not be used either in time
of peace or in time of war, except to protect or to indicate the
medical units and establishments and the <i>personnel</i> and material
protected by the Convention.</p>



<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Application and Carrying Out of the Convention</span></div>


<h4><i>Article 24</i></h4>

<p>The provisions of the present Convention are only binding
upon the Contracting Powers in the case of war between two or
more of them. These provisions shall cease to be binding from
the moment when one of the belligerent Powers is not a party to
the Convention.</p>


<h4><i>Article 25</i></h4>

<p>The Commanders-in-chief of belligerent armies shall arrange
the details for carrying out the preceding articles, as well as for
cases not provided for, in accordance with the instructions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
their respective Governments, and in conformity with the general
principles of the present Convention.</p>


<h4><i>Article 26</i></h4>

<p>The Signatory Governments will take the necessary measures
to instruct their troops, especially the <i>personnel</i> protected, in
the provisions of the present Convention, and to bring them to
the notice of the civil population.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Prevention of Abuses and Infractions</span></div>


<h4><i>Article 27</i></h4>

<p>The Signatory Governments, in countries the legislation of
which is not at present adequate for the purpose, undertake to
adopt or to propose to their legislative bodies such measures as
may be necessary to prevent at all times the employment of the
emblem or the name of Red Cross or Geneva Cross by private
individuals or by societies other than those which are entitled to
do so under the present Convention, and in particular for commercial
purposes as a trade-mark or trading mark.</p>

<p>The prohibition of the employment of the emblem or the
names in question shall come into operation from the date fixed
by each legislature, and at the latest five years after the present
Convention comes into force. From that date it shall no longer
be lawful to adopt a trade-mark or trading mark contrary to
this prohibition.</p>


<h4><i>Article 28</i></h4>

<p>The Signatory Governments also undertake to adopt, or to
propose to their legislative bodies, should their military law be
insufficient for the purpose, the measures necessary for the repression
in time of war of individual acts of pillage and maltreatment
of the wounded and sick of armies, as well as for the punishment,
as an unlawful employment of military insignia, of the improper
use of the Red Cross flag and armlet (<i>brassard</i>) by officers and
soldiers or private individuals not protected by the present
Convention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>They shall communicate to one another, through the Swiss
Federal Council, the provisions relative to these measures of
repression at the latest within five years from the ratification of
the present Convention.</p>



<div class="center"><span class="smcap">General Provisions</span></div>


<h4><i>Article 29</i></h4>

<p>The present Convention shall be ratified as soon as possible.
The ratifications shall be deposited at Berne.</p>

<p>When each ratification is deposited a <i>procès verbal</i> shall be
drawn up, and a copy thereof certified as correct shall be forwarded
through the diplomatic channel to all the Contracting
Powers.</p>


<h4><i>Article 30</i></h4>

<p>The present Convention shall come into force for each Power
six months after the date of the deposit of its ratification.</p>


<h4><i>Article 31</i></h4>

<p>The present Convention, duly ratified, shall replace the Convention
of August 22nd, 1864, in relations between the Contracting
States. The Convention of 1864 remains in force
between such of the parties who signed it who may not likewise
ratify the present Convention.</p>


<h4><i>Article 32</i></h4>

<p>The present Convention may be signed until December 31st
next by the Powers represented at the Conference, which was
opened at Geneva on June 11, 1906, as also by the Powers, not
represented at that Conference, which signed the Convention of
1864.</p>

<p>Such of the aforesaid Powers as shall have not signed the
present Convention by December 31st, 1906, shall remain free to
accede to it subsequently. They shall notify their accession by
means of a written communication addressed to the Swiss Federal
Council, and communicated by the latter to all the Contracting
Powers.</p>

<p>Other Powers may apply to accede in the same manner, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
their request shall only take effect if within a period of one year
from the notification of it to the Federal Council no objection
to it reaches the Council from any of the Contracting Powers.</p>


<h4><i>Article 33</i></h4>

<p>Each of the Contracting Powers shall be at liberty to denounce
the present Convention. The denunciation shall not take effect
until one year after the written notification of it has reached
the Swiss Federal Council. The Council shall immediately
communicate the notification to all the other Contracting Parties.</p>

<p>The denunciation shall only affect the Power which has
notified it.</p>

<p>Animated alike by the desire to diminish, as far as depends on

<p>Wishing with this object to adapt to maritime war the principles
of the Geneva Convention of July 6, 1906:</p>

<p>Have resolved to conclude a Convention for the purpose of
revising the Convention of July 29, 1899, relative to this question,
and have appointed as their Plenipotentiaries, that is to say:</p>

<div class="center">[Names of Plenipotentiaries.]</div>

<p>Who, after having deposited their full powers, found to be in
good and due form, have agreed upon the following provisions:&mdash;</p>


<h4><i>Article 1</i></h4>

<p>Military hospital-ships, that is to say, ships constructed or
adapted by States for the particular and sole purpose of aiding
the sick, wounded, and shipwrecked, the names of which have
been communicated to the belligerent Powers at the commencement
or during the course of hostilities, and in any case before they
are employed, shall be respected, and may not be captured while
hostilities last.</p>

<p>Such ships, moreover, are not on the same footing as war-ships
as regards their stay in a neutral port.</p>


<h4><i>Article 2</i></h4>

<p>Hospital-ships, equipped wholly or in part at the expense
of private individuals or officially recognised relief societies,
shall likewise be respected and exempt from capture, if the
belligerent Power to which they belong has given them an official
commission and has notified their names to the hostile Power at
the commencement of or during hostilities, and in any case before
they are employed.</p>

<p>Such ships shall be provided with a certificate from the proper
authorities declaring that the vessels have been under their
control while fitting out and on final departure.</p>


<h4><i>Article 3</i></h4>

<p>Hospital-ships, equipped wholly or in part at the expense of
private individuals or officially recognised societies of neutral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
countries, shall be respected and exempt from capture, on condition
that they are placed under the orders of one of the belligerents,
with the previous consent of their own Government and
with the authorisation of the belligerent himself, and on condition
also that the latter has notified their name to his adversary at the
commencement of or during hostilities, and in any case before they
are employed.</p>


<h4><i>Article 4</i></h4>

<p>The ships mentioned in Articles 1, 2, and 3 shall afford relief
and assistance to the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked of the
belligerents without distinction of nationality.</p>

<p>The Governments undertake not to use these ships for any
military purpose.</p>

<p>Such vessels must in no wise hamper the movements of the
combatants.</p>

<p>During and after an engagement they will act at their own
risk and peril.</p>

<p>The belligerents shall have the right to control and search
them; they may refuse to help them, order them off, make them
take a certain course, and put a Commissioner on board; they
may even detain them, if the situation is such as to require it.</p>

<p>The belligerents shall, as far as possible, enter in the log of the
hospital-ships the orders which they give them.</p>


<h4><i>Article 5</i></h4>

<p>Military hospital-ships shall be distinguished by being painted
white outside with a horizontal band of green about a metre and
a half in breadth.</p>

<p>The ships mentioned in Articles 2 and 3 shall be distinguished
by being painted white outside with a horizontal band of red
about a metre and a half in breadth.</p>

<p>The boats of the said ships, as also small craft which may be
used for hospital work, shall be distinguished by similar painting.</p>

<p>All hospital-ships shall make themselves known by hoisting,
with their national flag, the white flag with a red cross provided
by the Geneva Convention, and further, if they belong to a neutral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
State, by flying at the mainmast the national flag of the belligerent
under whose orders they are placed.</p>

<p>Hospital-ships which are detained under Article 4 by the
enemy must haul down the national flag of the belligerent to
whom they belong.</p>

<p>The ships and boats above mentioned which wish to ensure
by night the freedom from interference to which they are entitled,
must, subject to the assent of the belligerent they are accompanying,
take the necessary measures to render their special
painting sufficiently plain.</p>


<h4><i>Article 6</i></h4>

<p>The distinguishing signs referred to in Article 5 shall only be
used, whether in peace or war, for protecting or indicating the
ships therein mentioned.</p>


<h4><i>Article 7</i></h4>

<p>In the case of a fight on board a war-ship, the sick-bays shall be
respected and spared as far as possible.</p>

<p>The said sick-bays and the <i>matériel</i> belonging to them remain
subject to the laws of war; they cannot, however, be used for
any purpose other than that for which they were originally intended,
so long as they are required for the sick and wounded.</p>

<p>The commander into whose power they have fallen may, however,
if the military situation requires it, apply them to other
purposes, after seeing that the sick and wounded on board are
properly provided for.</p>


<h4><i>Article 8</i></h4>

<p>Hospital-ships and sick-bays of vessels are no longer entitled
to protection if they are employed for the purpose of injuring
the enemy.</p>

<p>The fact of the staff of the said ships and sick-bays being armed
for maintaining order and for defending the sick and wounded,
and the presence of wireless telegraphy apparatus on board, are
not sufficient reasons for withdrawing protection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Article 9</i></h4>

<p>Belligerents may appeal to the charity of the commanders of
neutral merchant-ships, yachts, or boats to take the sick and
wounded on board and tend them.</p>

<p>Vessels responding to this appeal, and also vessels which may
have of their own accord rescued sick, wounded, or shipwrecked
men, shall enjoy special protection and certain immunities. In
no case may they be captured for the sole reason of having such
persons on board; but, subject to any undertaking that may
have been given to them, they remain liable to capture for any
violations of neutrality they may have committed.</p>


<h4><i>Article 10</i></h4>

<p>The religious, medical, and hospital staff of any captured ship
is inviolable, and its members may not be made prisoners of war.
On leaving the ship they are entitled to remove their own private
belongings and surgical instruments.</p>

<p>They shall continue to discharge their duties so far as necessary,
and can afterwards leave, when the Commander-in-Chief considers
it permissible.</p>

<p>Belligerents must guarantee to the said staff, while in their
hands, the same allowances and pay as are given to the staff of
corresponding rank in their own navy.</p>


<h4><i>Article 11</i></h4>

<p>Sick or wounded sailors, soldiers on board, or other persons
officially attached to fleets or armies, whatever their nationality,
shall be respected and tended by the captors.</p>


<h4><i>Article 12</i></h4>

<p>Any war-ship belonging to a belligerent may demand the surrender
of sick, wounded, or shipwrecked men on board military
hospital-ships, hospital-ships belonging to relief societies or to
private individuals, merchant-ships, yachts, or boats, whatever
the nationality of such vessels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>


<h4><i>Article 13</i></h4>

<p>If sick, wounded, or shipwrecked persons are taken on board
a neutral war-ship, precaution must be taken, so far as possible,
that they do not again take part in the operations of the war.</p>


<h4><i>Article 14</i></h4>

<p>The sick, wounded, or shipwrecked of one of the belligerents
who fall into the power of the other belligerent are prisoners of
war. The captor must decide, according to circumstances, whether
to keep them, send them to a port of his own country, to a neutral
port, or even to an enemy port. In this last case, prisoners thus
repatriated may not serve again while the war lasts.</p>


<h4><i>Article 15</i></h4>

<p>The sick, wounded, or shipwrecked, who are landed at a
neutral port with the consent of the local authorities, must,
in default of arrangement to the contrary between the neutral
State and the belligerent States, be guarded by the neutral
States so as to prevent them from again taking part in the operations
of the war.</p>

<p>The expenses of tending them in hospital and interning them
shall be borne by the State to which the shipwrecked, sick, or
wounded persons belong.</p>


<h4><i>Article 16</i></h4>

<p>After every engagement, the two belligerents shall, so far as
military interests permit, take steps to look for the sick, wounded,
and shipwrecked, and to protect them, as well as the dead, against
pillage and improper treatment.</p>

<p>They shall see that the burial, whether by land or sea, or cremation
of the dead shall be preceded by a careful examination
of the corpse.</p>


<h4><i>Article 17</i></h4>

<p>Each belligerent shall send, as early as possible, the military
marks or documents of identity found on the dead and a list of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the names of the sick and wounded picked up by him to the
authorities of their country, navy, or army.</p>

<p>The belligerents shall keep each other informed as to internments
and transfers as well as to the admissions into hospital and
deaths which have occurred among the sick and wounded in their
hands. They shall collect all the objects of personal use, valuables,
letters, etc., which may be found in the captured ships, or
which may have been left by the sick or wounded who died in
hospital, in order to have them forwarded to the persons concerned
by the authorities of their own country.</p>


<h4><i>Article 18</i></h4>

<p>The provisions of the present Convention do not apply except
between Contracting Powers, and then only if all the belligerents
are parties to the Convention.</p>


<h4><i>Article 19</i></h4>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief of the belligerent fleets shall give
detailed directions for carrying out the preceding Articles and for
meeting cases not therein provided for, in accordance with the
instructions of their respective Governments and in conformity
with the general principles of the present Convention.</p>


<h4><i>Article 20</i></h4>

<p>The Signatory Powers shall take the necessary steps in order to
bring the provisions of the present Convention to the knowledge
of their naval forces, and especially of the members entitled
thereunder to immunity, and to make them known to the public.</p>


<h4><i>Article 21</i></h4>

<p>The Signatory Powers likewise undertake to enact or to propose
to their Legislatures, if their criminal laws are inadequate,
the measures necessary for checking in time of war individual
acts of pillage and ill-treatment in respect to the sick and wounded
in the fleet, as well as for punishing as an unjustifiable adoption
of naval or military marks, the unauthorised use of the distinctive
marks mentioned in Article 5, by vessels not protected by the
present Convention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>They shall communicate to each other, through the Netherland
Government, the enactments for preventing such acts at the
latest within five years of the ratification of the present Convention.</p>


<h4><i>Article 22</i></h4>

<p>In the case of operations of war between the land and sea
forces of belligerents, the provisions of the present Convention
are only applicable to the forces on board ship.</p>


<h4><i>Article 23</i></h4>

<p>The present Convention shall be ratified as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The ratifications shall be deposited at The Hague.</p>

<p>The first deposit of ratifications shall be recorded in a Protocol
signed by the Representatives of the Powers which take part
therein and by the Netherland Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>The subsequent deposits of ratifications shall be made by
means of a written notification, addressed to the Netherland
Government and accompanied by the instrument of ratification.</p>

<p>A duly certified copy of the Protocol relating to the first deposit
of ratifications, of the notifications mentioned in the preceding
paragraph, and of the instruments of ratification, shall be immediately
sent by the Netherland Government through the diplomatic
channel to the Powers invited to the Second Peace Conference, as
well as to the other Powers which have acceded to the Convention.
The said Government shall, in the cases contemplated in the
preceding paragraph, inform them at the same time of the date
on which it received the notification.</p>


<h4><i>Article 24</i></h4>

<p>Non-Signatory Powers which have accepted the Geneva
Convention of July 6, 1906, may accede to the present Convention.</p>

<p>A Power which desires to accede notifies its intention in writing
to the Netherland Government, forwarding to it the act of accession,
which shall be deposited in the archives of the said Government.</p>

<p>The said Government shall immediately forward to all the other
Powers a duly certified copy of the notification, as well as of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
act of accession, mentioning the date on which it received the
notification.</p>


<h4><i>Article 25</i></h4>

<p>The present Convention, duly ratified, shall replace, as between
Contracting Powers, the Convention of July 29, 1899, for the
adaptation to naval warfare of the principles of the Geneva
Convention.</p>

<p>The Convention of 1899 remains in force as between the Powers
which signed it but which do not also ratify the present Convention.</p>


<h4><i>Article 26</i></h4>

<p>The present Convention shall take effect, in the case of the
Powers which were parties to the first deposit of ratifications,
sixty days after the date of the Protocol recording such deposit,
and, in the case of the Powers which shall ratify subsequently
or which shall accede, sixty days after the notification of their
ratification or of their accession has been received by the Netherland
Government.</p>


<h4><i>Article 27</i></h4>

<p>In the event of one of the Contracting Powers wishing to
denounce the present Convention, the denunciation shall be
notified in writing to the Netherland Government, which shall
immediately communicate a duly certified copy of the notification
to all the other Powers, informing them of the date on which
it was received.</p>

<p>The denunciation shall only operate in respect of the denouncing
Power, and only on the expiry of one year after the notification
has reached the Netherland Government.</p>


<h4><i>Article 28</i></h4>

<p>A register kept by the Netherland Ministry for Foreign Affairs
shall record the date of the deposit of ratifications effected in
virtue of Article 23, paragraphs 3 and 4, as well as the date on
which the notifications of accession (Article 24, paragraph 2) or
of denunciation (Article 27, paragraph 1) have been received.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Each Contracting Power is entitled to have access to this
register and to be supplied with duly certified extracts from it.</p>

<p>In faith whereof the Plenipotentiaries have appended their
signatures to the present Convention.</p>

<p>Done at The Hague, October 18, 1907, in a single original,
which shall remain deposited in the archives of the Netherland
Government, and of which duly certified copies shall be sent,
through the diplomatic channel, to the Powers invited to the
Second Peace Conference.</p>
